## 🎯 What Changed

### Before Migration
```typescript
// Multiple stores, inconsistent state
src/state/subscriptionStore.ts          // Legacy store
src/features/subscription/store/...     // Modern store

// Components used different stores
ProfileScreen → Legacy store
PaywallModal (new) → Modern store
// State could be inconsistent!
```

### After Migration
```typescript
// Single source of truth
src/features/subscription/store/subscriptionStore.ts  // Only store

// All components use same store
ProfileScreen → Modern store
PaywallModal → Modern store
Ads → Modern store
// State is always consistent! ✅
```
