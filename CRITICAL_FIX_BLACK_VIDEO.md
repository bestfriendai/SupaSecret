# CRITICAL FIX: Black Video Issue

## What Was Wrong

The native caption-burner module was **hardcoding the video frame rate to 30 FPS** instead of using the source video's actual frame rate. This caused a mismatch that resulted in:

- ✅ Audio playing correctly
- ✅ Watermark visible
- ✅ Captions visible
- ❌ **VIDEO FRAMES ALL BLACK**

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Use Source Frame Rate** (CRITICAL)
**File**: `modules/caption-burner/ios/CaptionBurnerModule.swift`
**Lines**: 235-244

Changed from:
```swift
videoComposition.frameDuration = CMTime(value: 1, timescale: 30) // 30 FPS
```

To:
```swift
let sourceFrameRate = videoTrack.nominalFrameRate
if sourceFrameRate > 0 {
  videoComposition.frameDuration = CMTime(value: 1, timescale: Int32(sourceFrameRate))
  print("📹 Using source frame rate: \(sourceFrameRate) FPS")
} else {
  videoComposition.frameDuration = CMTime(value: 1, timescale: 30)
  print("📹 Using default frame rate: 30 FPS")
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Logging**
Added comprehensive logging to help debug future issues:
- Export session details (tracks, render size, frame duration)
- Export status (success/failure with error details)
- Output file size verification
- Warnings for suspiciously small files

### 3. **File Validation**
Added checks to ensure the output file:
- Actually exists
- Has a reasonable file size
- Isn't suspiciously small (< 1 KB = likely corrupt)

## How to Apply This Fix

### Step 1: Rebuild the Native Module

You MUST rebuild the native iOS module for these changes to take effect:

```bash
cd /Users/iamabillionaire/Downloads/SupaSecret

# Clean the build
rm -rf ios/build
rm -rf ios/Pods

# Reinstall pods
cd ios
pod install
cd ..

# Rebuild for iOS (CRITICAL - native code changed)
npx expo run:ios
```

### Step 2: Test the Fix

1. **Delete the app** from your iOS device (critical - ensures fresh native code)
2. **Rebuild and run** using `npx expo run:ios`
3. **Record a test video**
4. **Add blur** (optional)
5. **Add captions** (optional)
6. **Click Share**
7. **Check console logs** - you should see:
   ```
   📹 Using source frame rate: 30.0 FPS (or whatever your video's rate is)
   📤 Export session created:
      - Input video tracks: 1
      - Input audio tracks: 1
      - Render size: (width, height)
      - Frame duration: 1/30 (matches source!)
   ✅ Export COMPLETED successfully
   ✅ Output file size: X.XX MB
   ✅ Caption burning complete!
   ```

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

**Play the uploaded video in your app feed**:
- ✅ Video frames visible (NOT black!)
- ✅ Audio playing
- ✅ Watermark visible
- ✅ Captions visible (if added)
- ✅ Face blur visible (if applied)

## Why This Happened

When a video composition's frame duration doesn't match the source video:
1. AVFoundation tries to resample frames
2. If the mismatch is severe, frame extraction fails
3. The composition still "works" (audio, overlays work)
4. But video frames are dropped/black

**The fix**: Always use the source video's actual frame rate!

## If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check Console Logs

If you still see black video, look for these in console:

**Bad Signs**:
```
❌ Export FAILED with error: ...
⚠️ Output file size: 0.001 MB  (Way too small!)
❌ Output file does not exist
```

**Good Signs**:
```
✅ Export COMPLETED successfully
✅ Output file size: 5.2 MB  (Reasonable size)
📹 Using source frame rate: 30.0 FPS
```

### Additional Debug

If still broken:
1. **Check input video** - is the blurred video already black?
   - Test by downloading without watermark/captions
   - If download is black → blur issue
   - If download is fine → caption burner issue

2. **Check export preset** - try changing line 178:
   ```swift
   presetName: AVAssetExportPresetHighestQuality
   ```
   To:
   ```swift
   presetName: AVAssetExportPresetMediumQuality
   ```

3. **Check video codec** - some videos use codecs that don't play well with AVFoundation

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Clean everything
rm -rf ios/build ios/Pods node_modules package-lock.json

# Fresh install
npm install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Rebuild (this is critical!)
npx expo run:ios
```

## What Changed in Code

**File Modified**: `modules/caption-burner/ios/CaptionBurnerModule.swift`

**Lines Changed**:
- 172: Added `sourceFrameRate` parameter to function call
- 225: Added `sourceFrameRate` parameter to function signature
- 235-244: Use source frame rate instead of hardcoded 30 FPS
- 189-195: Added detailed export session logging
- 204-212: Enhanced export status logging
- 217-248: Added export error handling and file validation

**No TypeScript/JavaScript changes needed** - this is purely a native iOS fix.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

**Before Fix**:
- 🎥 Video: ❌ Black screen
- 🔊 Audio: ✅ Works
- 🏷️ Watermark: ✅ Visible
- 📝 Captions: ✅ Visible

**After Fix**:
- 🎥 Video: ✅ **VISIBLE!**
- 🔊 Audio: ✅ Works
- 🏷️ Watermark: ✅ Visible
- 📝 Captions: ✅ Visible

## Prevention

To prevent this in the future:
1. ✅ Always use source video properties (frame rate, resolution, etc.)
2. ✅ Never hardcode video parameters
3. ✅ Always log export details for debugging
4. ✅ Validate output file size

The fix ensures the video composition respects the source video's timing, which is critical for frame extraction.
