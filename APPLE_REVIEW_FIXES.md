# Apple Review Fixes - In-App Purchase Issues

## Issue Summary

**Apple's Rejection**: "Package could not be found" error during testing

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Error messages were shown as Alert dialogs to reviewers
2. Technical error messages instead of user-friendly messages
3. No graceful handling when products aren't available
4. Products not properly configured in App Store Connect

---

## ‚úÖ Code Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Error Handling in membershipStore.ts

**Before**:
```typescript
if (!pkg) {
  throw new Error(`Package ${planId} not found in RevenueCat offerings`);
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
if (!pkg) {
  console.warn(`Package ${planId} not found in offerings. Available packages:`,
    offerings.current.packages.map((p: any) => p.identifier));
  set({
    error: "This subscription option is temporarily unavailable. Please try another plan or contact support.",
    isLoading: false
  });
  return false;
}
```

**Changes**:
- ‚ùå Removed throwing errors that show to users
- ‚úÖ Added user-friendly error messages
- ‚úÖ Added logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Graceful error handling with early return

### 2. Removed Alert Dialogs from PaywallScreen.tsx

**Removed**:
- ‚ùå "Demo Mode" alert
- ‚ùå "Subscriptions Unavailable" alert
- ‚ùå "Error Loading Subscriptions" alert
- ‚ùå "Welcome to Plus!" success alert
- ‚ùå "Restore Complete" alert

**Why**: Apple reviewers see these as app completion bugs

**New Behavior**:
- ‚úÖ Errors displayed in UI (not blocking alerts)
- ‚úÖ Success navigates back immediately
- ‚úÖ Better empty state message with retry button
- ‚úÖ All errors logged to console for debugging

### 3. Improved Empty State UI

**New UI shows**:
- Clear "Subscription Options Unavailable" message
- Helpful explanation of possible causes
- "Try Again" button to retry loading
- No technical jargon or dev-specific messages

### 4. Fixed RevenueCatMCPService Error Handling

**Changed from**:
```typescript
throw new Error("Package not found");
```

**To**:
```typescript
return {
  success: false,
  data: null,
  message: "The selected subscription plan is not available",
};
```
