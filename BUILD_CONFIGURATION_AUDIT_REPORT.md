# Build Configuration Audit Report

Executive Summary
- Current Status: NOT PRODUCTION READY - Critical configuration gaps identified
- Primary Issues: Missing EAS environment variables, incomplete app.json production settings, potential iOS framework conflicts
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks to achieve production readiness
- Risk Level: HIGH - Several blocking issues prevent successful production deployment

Critical Blocking Issues (Must Fix)
1. EAS Environment Variables Missing
   - No environment variables configured in any EAS build profile
   - All EXPO_PUBLIC_* variables are undefined at build time
   - Supabase, AdMob, RevenueCat, and other services will fail
   - Impact: Complete app functionality failure

2. App.json Production Configuration Incomplete
   - Missing runtimeVersion for OTA updates
   - No iOS buildNumber or Android versionCode specified
   - Missing updates configuration
   - No extra object for runtime environment variables
   - Impact: App store submission failures, update mechanism broken

3. iOS Static Frameworks Conflict
   - useFrameworks: "static" conflicts with Expo SDK 54 precompiled frameworks
   - May cause build failures or performance degradation
   - Impact: iOS build failures or suboptimal performance

4. Android SDK Version Issues
   - compileSdkVersion: 36 and targetSdkVersion: 36 are Android 15 preview
   - Should use stable SDK 34 for production
   - May cause compatibility issues with Google Play Store
   - Impact: Potential app store rejection

High Priority Issues
1. Environment Variable Security Gaps
   - No validation for required environment variables
   - Inconsistent fallback patterns across services
   - Missing production environment variable documentation
   - Impact: Runtime failures, security vulnerabilities

2. Build Profile Configuration
   - Missing node version specification in EAS profiles
   - No explicit React Native version pinning
   - Missing iOS simulator configuration for development
   - Impact: Build inconsistencies, debugging difficulties

Medium Priority Issues
1. TypeScript Configuration
   - skipLibCheck: true may hide important type errors
   - moduleResolution: "bundler" may cause Jest compatibility issues
   - Impact: Potential runtime type errors

2. Metro Configuration
   - Missing asset plugin configurations for New Architecture
   - No explicit Hermes configuration
   - Impact: Potential asset loading issues

Compatibility Assessment
- New Architecture: Properly enabled and compatible with RN 0.81.4
- Expo SDK 54: Correctly configured with package exports enabled
- NativeWind: Properly integrated with JSX runtime
- Reanimated 4: Correctly configured with worklets plugin
- Babel/Metro: Properly configured for modern React Native

Security Analysis
- Environment variables properly use EXPO_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side access
- Supabase client uses secure storage for auth tokens
- No hardcoded secrets found in configuration files
- Production config template includes placeholder values (good)
- Missing: Environment variable validation and required variable enforcement

Performance Considerations
- Precompiled frameworks should improve iOS build times
- Static frameworks conflict may negate performance benefits
- Metro configuration optimized for Expo SDK 54
- Bundle size optimization opportunities exist

Recommendations Priority Matrix
- P0 (Blocking): Fix EAS environment variables, update app.json, resolve iOS framework conflict
- P1 (High): Add environment validation, update Android SDK versions
- P2 (Medium): Optimize TypeScript config, add build validation scripts
- P3 (Low): Performance optimizations, additional monitoring
