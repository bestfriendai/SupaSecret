# New Architecture Compatibility Report

Executive Summary
- React Native 0.81.4 with New Architecture enabled is properly configured
- Most dependencies are compatible, but several require attention
- Critical compatibility issues identified with beta dependencies
- Recommendations provided for achieving full New Architecture compatibility

New Architecture Status
- Enabled: `"newArchEnabled": true` in app.json
- React Native Version: 0.81.4 (supports New Architecture)
- Expo SDK: 54 (final version supporting Old Architecture fallback)
- Build Configuration: Properly configured for New Architecture

Dependency Compatibility Analysis

‚úÖ Fully Compatible Dependencies
- @react-navigation/* (v7.x) - Full New Architecture support
- react-native-reanimated (4.1.0) - Full New Architecture support with worklets
- react-native-gesture-handler - Compatible with New Architecture
- react-native-safe-area-context - Full compatibility
- react-native-screens - New Architecture compatible
- @react-native-async-storage/async-storage - Compatible
- react-native-mmkv - New Architecture compatible
- All Expo SDK modules - Full compatibility with SDK 54

‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Attention
- react-native-vision-camera (4.0.0-beta.13): Beta version, should upgrade to stable 4.7.2
- @react-native-firebase/* (19.2.2): Older version, should upgrade to 23.x for better New Architecture support
- @sentry/react-native (6.20.0): Very old version, should upgrade to latest for New Architecture compatibility
- react-native-google-mobile-ads: Verify New Architecture compatibility with current version

üîç Needs Verification
- ffmpeg-kit-react-native: Large native module, verify New Architecture compatibility
- react-native-video-processing: Custom native module, may need updates
- @react-native-ml-kit/face-detection: Verify compatibility with New Architecture
- @react-native-voice/voice: Check for New Architecture support

‚ùå Potential Issues
- react-native-voice (0.3.0): Very old version, likely not New Architecture compatible
- Custom patches in `patches_original/`: May conflict with New Architecture

iOS Static Frameworks Conflict
- Issue: `useFrameworks: "static"` in expo-build-properties conflicts with Expo SDK 54 precompiled frameworks
- Impact: May prevent use of precompiled React Native frameworks, reducing build performance
- Recommendation: Remove static frameworks setting to enable precompiled frameworks
- Alternative: Keep static if required, but accept slower build times

Build Performance Implications
- Precompiled Frameworks: Enabled by default in SDK 54, significantly faster iOS builds
- Static Frameworks Conflict: Current configuration may disable this optimization
- New Architecture Overhead: Minimal performance impact with proper configuration

Testing Requirements
- Development Builds: All native modules must be tested in development builds
- Expo Go Limitations: Many native modules won't work in Expo Go with New Architecture
- Platform Testing: Thorough testing required on both iOS and Android
- Performance Testing: Verify no performance regressions with New Architecture

Migration Recommendations

Immediate Actions (Critical)
1. Upgrade react-native-vision-camera from beta to stable (4.7.2)
2. Resolve iOS static frameworks conflict in expo-build-properties
3. Test all native modules in development builds
4. Verify app functionality with New Architecture enabled

High Priority Actions
1. Upgrade @react-native-firebase/* to version 23.x
2. Upgrade @sentry/react-native to latest version
3. Remove or update obsolete patches
4. Verify ffmpeg-kit-react-native New Architecture compatibility

Medium Priority Actions
1. Update react-native-voice to newer version or find alternative
2. Verify all ML Kit and voice recognition modules
3. Test video processing functionality thoroughly
4. Update any remaining dependencies to New Architecture compatible versions

Validation Checklist
- [ ] All native modules work in development builds
- [ ] No crashes or performance issues with New Architecture
- [ ] iOS builds work with or without static frameworks
- [ ] Android builds complete successfully
- [ ] All app features function correctly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable or improved
- [ ] No memory leaks or stability issues

Future Considerations
- Expo SDK 55+ will require New Architecture (no Old Architecture fallback)
- Plan for regular dependency updates to maintain compatibility
- Monitor React Native and Expo release notes for breaking changes
- Consider contributing to open source libraries for New Architecture support

Risk Assessment
- Low Risk: Most core dependencies are compatible
- Medium Risk: Beta dependencies and old versions need updates
- High Risk: Custom native modules may need significant updates
- Mitigation: Thorough testing and gradual migration approach
