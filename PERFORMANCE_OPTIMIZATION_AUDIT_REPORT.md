# Performance Optimization Audit Report

Executive Summary
- Current Status: NEEDS OPTIMIZATION – Multiple performance bottlenecks identified
- Primary Issues: Memory leaks, inefficient rendering, heavy video processing, large state updates
- Risk Level: MEDIUM–HIGH – Issues can degrade UX and stability
- Timeline: 2–3 weeks to implement all optimizations

Critical Performance Issues (Must Fix)
1. Memory Leaks (Critical)
- Video players in useVideoPlayers hook not properly disposed when component unmounts
- Real-time subscriptions in confessionStore accumulating without cleanup
- globalVideoStore Map not being cleared on app backgrounding
- Video processing temporary files not always cleaned up
- Impact: App crashes on low-memory devices, degraded performance over time

2. Heavy Video Processing Blocking Main Thread (Critical)
- VideoProcessingService runs FFmpeg-like operations synchronously
- Face blur and voice change processing blocks UI for 1–3 seconds
- Large video file uploads (up to 100MB) freeze the app
- No cancellation mechanism for long-running operations
- Impact: App becomes unresponsive during video processing

3. Inefficient Component Re-rendering (High)
- EnhancedVideoItem re-renders on every confession object change
- Large confession arrays cause entire lists to re-render
- Missing memoization in expensive calculations (hashtag extraction, trending)
- AnimatedActionButton creates new style objects on every render
- Impact: Janky scrolling, poor video playback performance

4. State Management Performance Issues (High)
- confessionStore loads up to 400 confessions in memory simultaneously
- Real-time updates trigger full state re-renders
- Video analytics updates cause unnecessary re-renders
- Large sample data mixed with real data in development
- Impact: Slow app startup, laggy interactions, excessive memory usage

5. Video Cache Performance Issues (Medium)
- videoCacheManager smart eviction runs on main thread
- Cache cleanup operations not properly batched
- Missing cache warming for upcoming videos
- No cache compression for older entries
- Impact: Stuttering during video transitions, storage space issues

Performance Bottleneck Analysis

Video Rendering Pipeline
- 8 video players pre-allocated per feed (high memory cost)
- Video switching triggers multiple player creation/disposal cycles
- BlurView overlay adds rendering overhead
- Progress tracking intervals (every 2s) accumulate
- Gesture handling conflicts with video player touch events

State Management Performance
- confessionStore: 400+ items with frequent updates
- Real-time subscriptions: 3 active channels with no throttling
- Video analytics: Frequent upserts to database
- User preferences: Synchronous updates blocking UI
- Offline queue: No batching for multiple operations

Component Rendering Performance
- FlashList: Correct props but missing item height optimization
- BottomSheetFlatList: Fixed height but no recycling optimization
- Animated components: Multiple useAnimatedStyle hooks per item
- Text rendering: No font optimization or text measurement caching
- Image loading: No progressive loading or placeholder optimization

Video Processing Performance
- FFmpeg operations: No worker thread isolation
- File I/O: Synchronous operations blocking main thread
- Transcription: Multiple API calls without batching
- Thumbnail generation: No size optimization or caching
- Cleanup: Synchronous file deletion operations

Memory Usage Analysis

High Memory Consumers
- Video players: ~50MB per active player (8 players ≈ 400MB)
- Video cache: 500MB limit but no compression
- Confession state: ~200KB per confession (400 confessions ≈ 80MB)
- Image cache: No size limits or optimization
- Real-time subscriptions: Accumulating event handlers

Memory Leak Sources
- Video player disposal not guaranteed
- Subscription cleanup missing in error scenarios
- Temporary file cleanup incomplete
- Animation value cleanup missing
- Timer/interval cleanup incomplete

Performance Monitoring Gaps

Missing Metrics
- Video playback performance (FPS, dropped frames)
- Memory usage tracking (heap size, garbage collection)
- Component render times and frequency
- Network request performance and caching efficiency
- User interaction response times

Existing Monitoring Issues
- storePerformanceMonitor disabled by default
- healthMonitor only tracks basic metrics
- No production performance alerting
- Missing performance regression detection
- No user experience metrics (time to interactive, etc.)
