## 📱 How It Works

### Automatic Environment Detection

```
RevenueCat reads Apple receipt
  ↓
Receipt contains environment flag
  ↓
Sandbox → sandbox.itunes.apple.com
Production → buy.itunes.apple.com
  ↓
Same code works everywhere!
```

### No Code Changes Needed

- ✅ Same API key for sandbox & production
- ✅ Same product IDs for sandbox & production
- ✅ Same entitlement for sandbox & production
