# Video Preview Freeze Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Video Preview Freezing After 2 Seconds ‚úÖ

**Root Causes:**
- Video player was trying to play before video was loaded
- No error handling for video loading failures
- Missing video file validation
- Incorrect URI formatting (missing `file://` prefix)
- State management issues with immediate path reset after navigation

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### VideoPreviewScreen.tsx
- ‚úÖ Added video loading state with loading overlay
- ‚úÖ Added player status monitoring (checks every 500ms)
- ‚úÖ Only auto-plays when status is "readyToPlay"
- ‚úÖ Added file existence validation
- ‚úÖ Fixed URI formatting to ensure `file://` prefix
- ‚úÖ Added error overlay for failed video loads
- ‚úÖ Added focus/blur handling for proper play/pause
- ‚úÖ Improved play/pause button UX (only shows when paused)
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive logging for debugging

#### FaceBlurRecordScreen.tsx & VisionCameraRecordScreen.tsx
- ‚úÖ Fixed URI formatting to ensure `file://` prefix
- ‚úÖ Delayed resetting `recordedVideoPath` by 500ms after navigation
- ‚úÖ Added validation and logging

### 2. Skia Canvas Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Error Message:**
```
ERROR  <Canvas onLayout={onLayout} /> is not supported on the new architecture
```

**Status:** This is a **warning only** and should not affect functionality.

**Why it appears:**
- `useSkiaFrameProcessor` internally uses Skia Canvas
- The warning appears even though new architecture is disabled
- It's a known issue with Vision Camera + Skia integration

**Configuration (Already Set):**
- ‚úÖ `app.config.js`: `newArchEnabled: false`
- ‚úÖ `ios/Podfile.properties.json`: `"newArchEnabled": "false"`

**To completely remove the warning:**
You need to rebuild the native app from scratch:

```bash
# iOS
cd ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
pod deintegrate
pod install
cd ..
npx expo run:ios --clean

# Android (when needed)
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npx expo run:android --clean
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Video Recording & Preview (Expo Go)

1. Open the app in Expo Go
2. Navigate to video recording screen
3. Press Record button
4. Record for 5-10 seconds
5. Press Stop button
6. Press Next button
7. **Expected:** Video preview screen should show:
   - Loading spinner briefly
   - Video starts playing automatically
   - Video loops continuously
   - No freezing after 2 seconds
   - Play/pause button works
   - Retake, Discard, and Share buttons work

### Test 2: Video Recording & Preview (Native Build)

1. Build and run native app: `npx expo run:ios`
2. Navigate to video recording screen
3. Press Record button (should see face blur in real-time)
4. Record for 5-10 seconds
5. Press Stop button
6. Press Next button
7. **Expected:** Same as Test 1, plus:
   - Face blur visible in preview
   - No Skia Canvas warnings (after clean rebuild)

### Test 3: Post Video

1. Complete Test 1 or Test 2
2. On preview screen, press Share button
3. **Expected:**
   - Upload progress shows
   - Success alert appears
   - Navigates back to home
   - Video appears in feed

## Debugging

### If video still freezes:

Check the console logs for these messages:

```
üìπ VideoPreviewScreen - Video URI: file:///path/to/video.mp4
üé¨ Video player initialized
üìä Player status: loading
üìä Player status: readyToPlay
‚úÖ Video ready to play
```

If you see:
- `‚ùå Video player error` - Video file is corrupted or invalid
- `‚ùå Video file does not exist` - Recording didn't save properly
- Status stuck on `loading` - Video file format issue

### If record button doesn't work:

Check console for:
```
üé¨ Starting camera recording...
‚úÖ Recording finished: /path/to/video.mp4
```

If recording doesn't start:
- Check camera permissions
- Check microphone permissions
- Check available storage space

### If Next button doesn't appear:

After stopping recording, you should see:
```
üé¨ Navigating to VideoPreview with video: /path/to/video.mp4
üìπ Video URI for preview: file:///path/to/video.mp4
```

If Next button doesn't appear:
- Recording may have failed
- Check `recordedVideoPath` state
- Check console for errors

## Code Changes Summary

### VideoPreviewScreen.tsx
- Added imports: `useRef`, `useFocusEffect`, `FileSystem`
- Added states: `isLoading`, `videoError`
- Added `hasStartedPlayingRef` to track first play
- Added video URI formatting
- Added player status monitoring
- Added file validation
- Added focus/blur handling
- Updated UI with loading and error overlays
- Updated play/pause button logic

### FaceBlurRecordScreen.tsx
- Updated `handleNextPress` with URI formatting
- Added 500ms delay before resetting video path
- Added logging

### VisionCameraRecordScreen.tsx
- Updated `handleNextPress` with URI formatting
- Added 500ms delay before resetting video path
- Added logging

## Known Issues

1. **Skia Canvas Warning** - Harmless warning that appears in console. Will disappear after clean native rebuild.

2. **Expo Go Limitations** - Face blur and voice change are simulated in Expo Go. Build native app for real-time effects.

## Next Steps

1. Test video recording and preview in Expo Go
2. Verify all buttons work (Record, Stop, Next, Retake, Discard, Share)
3. Test posting a video
4. If everything works in Expo Go, build native app
5. Test face blur in native build
6. Verify Skia warning is gone after clean rebuild

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Video records successfully
- ‚úÖ Next button appears after recording
- ‚úÖ Video preview loads and plays
- ‚úÖ Video doesn't freeze after 2 seconds
- ‚úÖ Video loops continuously
- ‚úÖ Play/pause works
- ‚úÖ Share button uploads video
- ‚úÖ Video appears in feed after posting
