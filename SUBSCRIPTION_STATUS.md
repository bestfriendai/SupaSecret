## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: StoreKit Configuration Required

**Error in logs:**

[StoreKit] Error enumerating unfinished transactions: Error Domain=ASDErrorDomain Code=509 "No active account"
```

### Why This Happens:
The StoreKit configuration file (`ToxicConfessions.storekit`) exists but **is not added to Xcode**. This is required for sandbox testing.

   ```bash
   open ios/ToxicConfessions.xcworkspace
   ```

   - In Project Navigator (left sidebar), find "ToxicConfessions" folder (blue icon)

   - Navigate to: `ios/ToxicConfessions.storekit`
   - **UNCHECK** "Copy items if needed"
   - **CHECK** "Add to targets: ToxicConfessions"
   - Click "Add"

3. **Configure Scheme:**
   - Menu bar: Product ‚Üí Scheme ‚Üí Edit Scheme (or `‚åò + <`)
   - Select "Run" in left sidebar
   - Click "Options" tab
   - Under "StoreKit Configuration", select **ToxicConfessions.storekit**
   - Click "Close"

4. **Clean and Rebuild:**
   - Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder (`‚áß + ‚åò + K`)
   - Then rebuild: `npx expo run:ios`

5. **Test:**
   - Launch app
   - Navigate to Profile ‚Üí Upgrade to Plus
   - You should see:
     - ‚úÖ Premium Monthly ($4.99/month)
     - ‚úÖ Premium Annual ($29.99/year)
     - ‚úÖ Premium Lifetime ($49.99)
