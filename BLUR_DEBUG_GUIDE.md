# Face Blur Upload Issue - Debug Guide

## Problem
Videos are being posted with watermark and captions visible, but the face blur is missing.

## Added Debug Logging

I've added comprehensive logging to help diagnose exactly where the blur is being lost. Here's what to look for:

### Test Steps

1. **Record a video** on your iOS device (not simulator)
2. **Apply blur** by clicking the "Blur" button in preview
3. **Optionally add captions**
4. **Click "Share"**
5. **Check the console logs carefully**

### Expected Log Flow (When Working Correctly)

#### Step 1: When Blur is Applied
```
🎭 Starting face blur processing...
🎭 Blur progress: 0% - Initializing blur...
🎭 Blur progress: 20% - Processing video...
🎭 Blur progress: 100% - Blur applied!

✅ ========== BLUR APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY ==========
✅ Input video (original): file:///path/to/original.mov
✅ Output video (blurred): file:///path/to/blurred_12345.mov
✅ Updating currentVideoUri state to blurred video...
✅ ================================================
✅ State updated! currentVideoUri should now point to blurred video
✅ When you click Share, this blurred video should be used
```

**KEY THINGS TO CHECK:**
- ✅ Input and output video paths should be DIFFERENT
- ✅ Output video should have a different filename (usually with timestamp or "blurred" in name)
- ✅ No errors in the blur process

#### Step 2: When Share is Clicked
```
📤 ========== SHARE VIDEO DEBUG ==========
📤 currentVideoUri: file:///path/to/blurred_12345.mov
📤 originalVideoUri: file:///path/to/original.mov
🎭 hasBlurApplied: true
📝 hasCaptionsApplied: true (or false)
📝 processedVideo.transcription exists: true (or false)
📤 Are URIs different? (blur applied): true
📤 ========================================
```

**KEY THINGS TO CHECK:**
- ✅ `currentVideoUri` should point to the BLURRED video (different path from original)
- ✅ `originalVideoUri` should point to the ORIGINAL video
- ✅ `hasBlurApplied` should be `true`
- ✅ "Are URIs different?" should be `true`

**❌ IF YOU SEE THIS:**
```
❌ CRITICAL ERROR: hasBlurApplied is true but video URI hasn't changed!
❌ This means blur was not actually applied to the video file.
```
Then you'll get an alert asking if you want to cancel or upload anyway.

#### Step 3: Watermark/Caption Burning (iOS)
```
🏷️ Processing video with watermark...
🏷️ Logo loaded: file:///path/to/logo.png

📝 Parsing captions from in-memory transcription data
✅ Parsed captions from in-memory data: 8 segments

📝 Final caption segments for burning: 8

🏷️ ========== WATERMARK BURNING DEBUG ==========
🏷️ Input video for burning: file:///path/to/blurred_12345.mov
🏷️ Caption segments to burn: 8
🏷️ This should be BLURRED video if blur was applied!
🏷️ ============================================

🏷️ Watermark progress: 0%
🏷️ Watermark progress: 50%
🏷️ Watermark progress: 100%
✅ Video processed with watermark successfully: file:///path/to/final_output.mov
```

**KEY THINGS TO CHECK:**
- ✅ "Input video for burning" should be the BLURRED video path (same as currentVideoUri)
- ✅ NOT the original video path!
- ✅ Watermark processing should complete successfully

#### Step 4: Upload
```
📤 Preparing video for upload: file:///path/to/final_output.mov
🎭 Face blur applied: true
📝 Captions included: true ✅

📤 Uploading video: file:///path/to/final_output.mov
```

**KEY THINGS TO CHECK:**
- ✅ The video being uploaded should be the output of the watermark burning process
- ✅ This video should contain: blur + watermark + captions

## Diagnosis Guide

### Scenario 1: Blur Never Gets Applied
**Symptoms:**
- No "BLUR APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY" logs appear
- OR blur fails with an error

**Possible Causes:**
- Blur service not available (not a native build)
- Video file can't be read
- Native blur module error

**Fix:**
- Check if you're running on a real iOS device (not Expo Go)
- Check if native blur module is properly linked
- Check device storage space

### Scenario 2: Blur Applied But State Not Updated
**Symptoms:**
- "BLUR APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY" logs show different input/output paths
- BUT when Share is clicked, `currentVideoUri` still points to original
- "CRITICAL ERROR" alert appears

**Possible Causes:**
- React state update failed
- Component unmounted/remounted between blur and share
- Memory issue

**Fix:**
- This is the most likely cause of your issue!
- Check if anything is causing the component to remount
- Check if there are any errors in React state updates

### Scenario 3: Wrong Video Used for Burning
**Symptoms:**
- "BLUR APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY" logs look correct
- "SHARE VIDEO DEBUG" shows correct currentVideoUri (blurred)
- BUT "WATERMARK BURNING DEBUG" shows ORIGINAL video path being used

**Possible Causes:**
- Variable shadowing or closure issue
- Wrong variable being passed to burnCaptionsAndWatermarkIntoVideo

**Fix:**
- This would be a code bug - need to fix the variable reference

### Scenario 4: Burning Process Strips Blur
**Symptoms:**
- ALL logs look correct
- Input to burning is the blurred video
- Watermark/captions work fine
- BUT final video is not blurred

**Possible Causes:**
- Native caption-burner module is re-encoding video incorrectly
- Video decoder/encoder issue in Swift code
- Frame processing bug

**Fix:**
- This would be a native module bug
- Need to check the Swift implementation of CaptionBurnerModule
- May need to adjust video encoding settings

## What to Do Next

1. **Run through the test steps above**
2. **Copy ALL the debug logs** from your console
3. **Look for any of the scenarios above**
4. **Share the logs with me** - I can help identify the exact issue

The logs will tell us exactly where the blur is being lost:
- ❌ Never applied in the first place?
- ❌ Applied but state not updated?
- ❌ State updated but wrong video used for burning?
- ❌ Correct video used but burning process strips blur?

## Quick Test

To quickly test if the issue is with the burning process:

1. Apply blur to a video
2. **Download the video** (click "Save" button)
3. Check the downloaded video in your Photos app
4. **Is it blurred?**
   - ✅ YES: The blur IS working, issue is with the burning/upload process
   - ❌ NO: The blur is NOT being applied properly

If the downloaded video IS blurred but the uploaded video is NOT, then we know the issue is specifically with the watermark/caption burning process using the wrong input video.

## Additional Safeguards Added

1. **State Validation**: Before upload, checks if `hasBlurApplied` matches whether URIs are different
2. **Detailed Logging**: Every step logs exactly which video file is being used
3. **User Alert**: If mismatch detected, alerts user before uploading

These should help catch the issue earlier and prevent uploading unblurred videos.
