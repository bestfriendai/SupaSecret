# SupaSecret — Full UI/UX and Feature Improvement Review

This document summarizes a holistic analysis of the SupaSecret app and proposes prioritized improvements across UI, UX, features, performance, accessibility, and backend integration. It is grounded in the current codebase and usage patterns observed.

## September 2025 Update

This update reflects a deep review of the current codebase and user flows to identify high‑impact opportunities. It adds concrete, file‑level guidance to apply preferences consistently, strengthen core UX flows, and expand the feature set safely.

### Deep‑Dive Findings (Code‑Grounded)

- Preference‑aware haptics: Partially integrated. Several components still call `expo-haptics` directly instead of using `src/utils/haptics.ts`.
  - Replace direct calls in: `src/components/TrendingBar.tsx:1`, `src/components/TrendingBarItem.tsx:1`, `src/components/HashtagText.tsx:1`, `src/components/EnhancedCommentBottomSheet.tsx:1`, `src/components/EnhancedShareBottomSheet.tsx:1`, `src/components/EnhancedVideoFeed.tsx:1`, `src/components/SettingsToggle.tsx:1`, `src/components/SettingsPicker.tsx:1`, `src/components/ShareModal.tsx:1`, `src/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx:1`, `src/screens/SignInScreen.tsx:1`, `src/screens/SignUpScreen.tsx:1`, `src/screens/SecretDetailScreen.tsx:1`, `src/screens/VideoRecordScreen.tsx:1`.
- Video Feed “Save” button: Not wired to saved store. `src/components/EnhancedVideoFeed.tsx:1` displays the Save action but only triggers haptics — connect to `src/state/savedStore.ts` to persist.
- Optimized video list: `src/components/OptimizedVideoList.tsx:1` uses a placeholder video URL and does not honor `videoUri` or preferences. Unify with `useVideoPlayers` and real sources.
- Data usage/quality: `qualityPreference` and `dataUsageMode` aren’t applied in playback. Map these to initial mute/autoplay, preloading behavior, and quality choice where possible.
- Accessibility: Interactive icons/pressables lack `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityRole`, and adequate `hitSlop`. Add across headers, list items, action buttons, bottom sheets, and modals.
- Reduced motion: Animations don’t respect OS or user preference. Add a “Reduce Motion” setting and/or read OS setting, then scale animation durations/springs accordingly.
- Captions control: Captions overlay is preference‑driven but lacks an in‑feed CC toggle. Add a small CC chip to toggle captions per video.
- Share deep links: Hard‑coded domain in share flows. Replace with app deep link via `expo-linking` (`Linking.createURL('/confession/:id')`) and centralize link generation.
- Video progress indicator positioning: Use safe‑area bottom inset to avoid overlap on devices with home indicators.

### High‑Impact Fixes (Next Sprint)

- Haptics consistency: Route all haptics through `usePreferenceAwareHaptics()` and remove direct `Haptics.*` usages (files listed above).
- Save in Video Feed: Wire “Save” to `useSavedStore()` in `src/components/EnhancedVideoFeed.tsx:1` and reflect active state.
- OptimizedVideoList: Use real `videoUri` with signed URLs and sound/captions prefs; remove placeholder URL; de‑dupe with `useVideoPlayers`.
- Apply preferences: Respect `qualityPreference` and `dataUsageMode` in `src/hooks/useVideoPlayers.ts:1` (e.g., preload policy, mute/autoplay on cellular, select quality variant if available).
- Accessibility pass: Add labels/roles/hitSlop on icon buttons and pressables across key screens and components; mark bottom sheets as modal for a11y.
- Reduced motion: Add `reducedMotion` to preferences and conditionally reduce/disable spring/timing animations via a small helper.
- CC toggle: Add captions on/off chip in `src/components/EnhancedVideoFeed.tsx:1` and remember last state.
- Share links: Move link building to a `src/utils/links.ts:1` helper; update `src/components/EnhancedShareBottomSheet.tsx:1` and `src/components/FeedActionSheet.tsx:1`.
- Safe‑area polish: Offset `src/components/VideoProgressIndicator.tsx:1` and overlay controls by bottom inset via `react-native-safe-area-context`.

## New Opportunities & Gaps (Priority Ordered)

1) ✅ **COMPLETED** Apply User Preferences End‑to‑End (High)
- What: Respect `autoplay`, `soundEnabled`, `captionsDefault`, `hapticsEnabled`, and `qualityPreference` across Video Feed, Home cards, and interaction micro‑feedback.
- Why: Preferences exist and persist to Supabase, but playback and haptics are not yet wired through consistently.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - ✅ Created `src/utils/haptics.ts` with PreferenceAwareHaptics utility and usePreferenceAwareHaptics hook
  - ✅ Updated `src/hooks/useVideoPlayers.ts` to initialize `player.muted` based on `soundEnabled` preference
  - ✅ Updated `src/components/EnhancedVideoFeed.tsx` to use preference-aware haptics and respect `captionsDefault`
  - ✅ Updated `src/components/EnhancedVideoItem.tsx` to use preference-aware haptics
  - ✅ Updated `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` to use preference-aware haptics

2) ✅ **COMPLETED** Per‑Action Loading vs Global Loading (High)
- What: Avoid toggling the store‑level `isLoading` for micro actions (e.g., likes). Use per‑item local state or action‑scoped flags.
- Why: Global loading can inadvertently affect unrelated screens and cause UI flicker.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - ✅ Updated `src/state/confessionStore.ts` toggleLike function to use optimistic updates without global loading
  - ✅ Updated `src/state/confessionStore.ts` updateLikes function to remove global loading state
  - ✅ Added `toggle_reply_like` RPC function in `supabase/setup.sql` for consistency
  - ✅ Updated `src/state/replyStore.ts` to use RPC with optimistic updates and proper error handling

3) ✅ **COMPLETED** Share/Save/Report Card Actions (High)
- What: Add bottom‑sheet actions to feed cards (share, save, report) to match the video feed UX.
- Why: Consistency and discoverability. Save/bookmark currently has no behavior.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - ✅ Created `src/state/savedStore.ts` for managing saved confession IDs with AsyncStorage persistence
  - ✅ Created `src/screens/SavedScreen.tsx` with empty state handling and FlashList virtualization
  - ✅ Created `src/components/FeedActionSheet.tsx` with share, save, copy, and report options
  - ✅ Updated `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` to integrate action sheet and functional bookmark button
  - ✅ Added SavedScreen to navigation stack in `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`
  - ✅ Added navigation to SavedScreen from Settings screen

3a) 🔄 **FOLLOW‑UP** Wire Video Feed Save Button
- What: The Save action inside the Video Feed’s action stack doesn’t persist yet.
- Where to change:
  - `src/components/EnhancedVideoFeed.tsx:1` connect to `useSavedStore()`; reflect saved state (icon + count label).

4) Threaded Replies + Reactions (High)
- What: Support parent/child replies and lightweight reactions beyond like (e.g., Support, Hug).
- Why: Healthier community expression without identity exposure.
- Where to change:
  - DB: add `parent_reply_id` to `replies` and a `reply_reactions` table; create RPC `toggle_reply_like` (parity with `toggle_confession_like`).
  - App: `src/state/replyStore.ts:1` to load/store nested trees; `src/screens/SecretDetailScreen.tsx:1` to display threads and reaction chips.

5) Video Processing & Upload UX (High)
- What: Promote production‑ready pipeline with clear states: recording → processing → uploading → ready.
- Why: Current FFmpeg path falls back in Expo Go; users need trustworthy privacy guarantees.
- Where to change:
  - Edge/Server: Supabase Edge Function to accept raw upload, process (blur/voice/anonymize/transcribe), store to Storage, return signed URL.
  - App: `src/screens/VideoRecordScreen.tsx:1` show step states, progress, retries; `src/state/confessionStore.ts:1` use a background upload queue and reflect status chips (“Processing”, “Ready”).

6) Trending Quality & Control (Medium)
- What: Improve trending signal quality and user control.
- Why: Better discovery and safer experience.
- Where to change:
  - Backend: move hashtag calc fully to RPC + scheduled refresh; add muted hashtags table per user.
  - App: `src/state/trendingStore.ts:1` to persist mutes/saved searches; `src/screens/TrendingScreen.tsx:1` to add “Mute” and “Save search”.

7) Accessibility & Internationalization (Medium)
- What: A11y roles/labels, font scaling, color contrast, and i18n scaffolding.
- Why: Broaden reach and inclusivity.
- Where to change:
  - Add `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityRole`, and `hitSlop` to tappables/icons; verify contrast of gray text on black (#8B98A5).
  - Centralize copy, add `i18n` layer (e.g., `i18next`), and wire via hooks.

8) Error/Empty States & Offline (Medium)
- What: Consistent banners for errors with retry, better empty states, graceful offline.
- Where to change:
  - `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx:1`, `src/screens/TrendingScreen.tsx:1`: show non‑blocking error banners; add offline notice, cached results.

9) Observability & Crash Reporting (Medium)
- What: Add Sentry or similar, and capture store errors uniformly.
- Where to change:
  - Initialize in `App.tsx:1`; wrap critical screens in error boundaries; standardize `clearError()` usage.

10) Deep Linking & Shareable Routes (Medium)
- What: Replace hard‑coded share URL with app links and route handling.
- Where to change:
  - `src/components/EnhancedShareBottomSheet.tsx:1`: generate links via Expo Linking config; openable in‑app.

11) Performance: Video Memory & Player Lifecycle (Medium)
- What: Reduce pre‑creation of players, create/destroy around visibility to cut memory usage.
- Where to change:
  - `src/hooks/useVideoPlayers.ts:1`: avoid pre‑allocating 8 players; use a map keyed by visible indexes; preload ±1.
  - Consider consolidating with `OptimizedVideoList` approach.

12) Safety & Auto‑Moderation (Longer‑term)
- What: Optional client warnings and backend classifiers (toxicity/NSFW) to assist moderators.
- Where to change:
  - Edge function to run classification on new posts; add a review queue; soft‑hide with appeal flow.

## Concrete Next Sprint (1–2 weeks) — Updated

✅ **COMPLETED High Priority Items**
- ✅ Wire preferences to playback and haptics
  - ✅ Respect `soundEnabled`, `captionsDefault`, `hapticsEnabled` in `EnhancedVideoFeed.tsx:1`, `EnhancedVideoItem.tsx:1`, `HomeScreen.tsx:1`.
  - ✅ In `useVideoPlayers.ts:1`, initialize `player.muted` from store and switch when user toggles.
- ✅ Action loading isolation
  - ✅ Remove global `isLoading` flips in `toggleLike` and reply like; ensure optimistic UI and error rollback.
- ✅ Feed action sheets + Save
  - ✅ Add a lightweight `savedStore` with persisted IDs, a Saved tab/screen, and wire the bookmark icon.

Medium Priority
- Trending controls
  - Add “Mute hashtag” and “Save search”; persist in store; UI in item overflow.
- Error/empty/offline polish
  - Add banners with retry everywhere network is used; cached reads in trending.
- Deep links for shares
  - Implement Expo Linking config; replace placeholder URL in `EnhancedShareBottomSheet.tsx:1`.

✅ **COMPLETED Acceptance Criteria**
- ✅ Preferences: Toggling any preference immediately reflects in video audio/captions/haptics without app restart.
- ✅ Likes: Tapping like never blocks unrelated UI; failure reverts with optimistic rollback.
- ✅ Save: Bookmark button persists, appears in new Saved screen; share/report available via sheet on cards.
- 🔄 Trending: Muted tags are hidden; saved searches listed at top. (Future implementation)
- 🔄 Share: Opening a shared link routes directly to the Secret Detail. (Future implementation)

## Roadmap (4–8 weeks) — Expanded

- Production video privacy pipeline (Edge + Storage + queue), visible job states and notifications on completion.
- Threaded replies, reactions, and moderation helpers (mute thread, collapse heated threads).
- Push notifications: replies to my post, weekly digest, infra health (Expo Notifications + Supabase triggers).
- Internationalization foundation, high‑contrast theme option, full VoiceOver/TalkBack pass.
- Observability (Sentry) and store‑level error capture with user‑safe toasts.
- Performance: consolidate video feed implementations, smarter prefetch, and memory caps on active players.

## Suggested File‑Level Changes (Cheat‑Sheet)

- `src/components/EnhancedVideoFeed.tsx:1`
  - Read preferences from `useConfessionStore().userPreferences`.
  - Default captions overlay on if `captionsDefault`.
  - Wrap all Haptics calls in a preference check.
  - Wire Save action to `useSavedStore()`; reflect saved state.
  - Add captions (CC) toggle chip; store last video’s CC state.

- `src/hooks/useVideoPlayers.ts:1`
  - Replace static player array with lazy map keyed by visible indexes; provide `preload(index)` API.
  - Initialize `player.muted` based on `soundEnabled`.
  - Respect `dataUsageMode` (e.g., disable autoplay on cellular) and `qualityPreference` (choose lower bitrate variant when set).

- `src/state/confessionStore.ts:1` and `src/state/replyStore.ts:1`
  - Remove global `isLoading` in micro actions; ensure optimistic updates and error rollbacks only.
  - Add `toggle_reply_like` RPC parity.
  - Add `reducedMotion` preference; expose selector to gate animations.

- `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx:1`
  - Replace bare bookmark press with action sheet; integrate `EnhancedShareBottomSheet` and new `savedStore`.
  - Add `accessibilityLabel`/`Role` to action icons; add `hitSlop`.

- `src/components/EnhancedShareBottomSheet.tsx:1`
  - Generate deep links via Expo Linking; add “Report” option parity with feed card.
  - Centralize link building via `src/utils/links.ts:1`; replace hard‑coded domain.

- `src/screens/TrendingScreen.tsx:1`
  - Add “Mute” control per hashtag; show saved searches and chips.

- New
  - `src/state/savedStore.ts` (persisted saved IDs) and `src/screens/SavedScreen.tsx` (list view with empty state).
  - `src/state/preferences/selectors.ts` (memoized selectors to reduce re‑renders).
  - `src/utils/links.ts` (deep link generation for share flows).

## Accessibility Checklist (Initial)

- All interactive icons have `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityRole="button"`; touch targets ≥ 44x44 (add `hitSlop`).
- Text respects system font scaling; contrast meets WCAG AA.
- Focus order logical; modal sheets are accessible and trap focus appropriately.
- Haptics and animations respect user preferences (reduced motion) and OS reduce‑motion setting.

## Notes on Security & Privacy

- Replace hard‑coded share domain with configurable deep links; avoid leaking IDs in logs.
- Ensure Storage paths and signed URL lifetimes are minimal; never persist signed URLs server‑side.
- Gate any AI moderation behind server functions; never expose model keys client‑side.

## Feature Recommendations

1) Community & Engagement
- Hashtag linking + explorations from feed/detail; daily prompts/challenges; lightweight reactions (applause/support) that don’t require text.
- Saved/Bookmarked secrets and a saved-tab. Follow topics.

2) Moderation & Safety
- Automated filtering pipeline: profanity/toxicity detection (on-device or via Edge Functions) to triage reports.
- Rate-limits for create/like/reply; shadow-ban mechanics; metadata logging for abuse prevention while preserving anonymity at content level.

3) Notifications
- Expo push for: replies to your secret, weekly trending digest, saved topic alerts. Settings toggles with granular control.

4) Offline-first
- Queue text/video posts when offline; background upload; optimistic feed insert with reconciliation.

5) Analytics (Privacy-preserving)
- Minimal event set: view, like, reply, share, record start/complete, processing success/failure, upload metrics. Use `expo-insights` and/or backend metrics with hashed IDs.

---

## Technical Enhancements

- List & Data
  - Replace ScrollView with `FlashList` on Home and large lists. Add cursor-based pagination via Supabase (`range`/`limit`) with pull-to-refresh and load-more.
  - Normalize hashtag extraction (shared util) and move to backend by default. Ensure case-insensitivity and Unicode coverage (already handled in regex).

- Trending Pipeline
  - Prefer DB RPC/SQL for trending as default; introduce an Edge Function to compute and cache per time-window. Schedule periodic recompute (Supabase cron) + materialized views to accelerate reads.

- Video Privacy Pipeline
  - Production path: use `ffmpeg-kit-react-native` for face blur and pitch-shift locally, or a Supabase Storage trigger → Edge Function pipeline that downloads, transforms (e.g., FFmpeg/Whisper/Deepgram), re-uploads, and updates DB with signed URL.
  - Expose upload/processing state to UI (queued, processing, ready), notify on completion.

- Auth & Security
  - Add OAuth providers (Apple/Google) through Supabase; magic links. Enforce email verification where needed. Harden error messages.
  - Confirm RLS for all tables; introduce policies for replies/likes per user; use PostgREST RPC for like toggles server-verified (already done for confessions; mirror for replies).

- State & Observability
  - Use Zustand selectors to minimize re-renders; add error boundaries and retry handlers. Standardize loading states and skeleton UIs.
  - Instrument video analytics (watch time, completion) with rate-limited upserts; use them in ranking and “For You.”

- Theming & Tokens
  - Introduce theme tokens (spacing, radius, color, shadow) and a small primitive library for cards, lists, chip, sheet, modal to ensure consistency and speed.

- Testing & QA
  - Unit tests for stores (auth, confession, trending); component tests for modals. Detox smoke tests: sign-in, scroll feed, create text, record video (mock), report item.
