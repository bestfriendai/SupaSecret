## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

**`src/screens/FaceBlurRecordScreen.tsx`**
- Added `Switch` import from React Native
- Added toggle state management (enableFaceBlur, enableVoiceChange, voiceEffect)
- Updated `CameraScreen` component to accept toggle props
- Added toggle UI components before record button
- Updated frame processor to respect enableFaceBlur toggle
- Added conditional rendering for voice effect selector
- Updated navigation to pass toggle states to preview screen

### State Management

```typescript
const [enableFaceBlur, setEnableFaceBlur] = useState(true);
const [enableVoiceChange, setEnableVoiceChange] = useState(true);
const [voiceEffect, setVoiceEffect] = useState<"deep" | "light">("deep");
```

### Frame Processor Update

```typescript
const frameProcessor = useSkiaFrameProcessor(
  (frame: any) => {
    "worklet";
    frame.render();
    
    // Only apply face blur if enabled
    if (!enableFaceBlur) {
      return;
    }
    
    // ... rest of blur logic
  },
  [detectFaces, handleDetectedFaces, blurRadius, enableFaceBlur]
);
```

### Navigation Update

```typescript
(navigation as any).navigate("VideoPreview", {
  processedVideo: {
    uri: videoUri,
    duration: recordingTime,
    faceBlurApplied: enableFaceBlur,      // ← Passed from toggle
    voiceChangeApplied: enableVoiceChange, // ← Passed from toggle
  },
});
```
