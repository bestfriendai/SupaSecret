- **Features**:
  - Complete type definitions for reports
  - Human-readable labels for report reasons
  - Type-safe interfaces for all report operations

### 3. Report Store (State Management)
- **File**: `src/state/reportStore.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Zustand store for report management
  - `createReport()` function with validation
  - `getUserReports()` function
  - Error handling and loading states
  - Persistent storage with AsyncStorage

### 4. UI Components
- **File**: `src/components/ReportModal.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Modal for selecting report reasons
  - Form validation
  - Support for both confessions and replies
  - Animated modal with gesture handling
  - Integration with report store

### 5. UI Integration
- **HomeScreen** (`src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`):
  - Added report button (flag icon) next to like/comment buttons
  - Integrated ReportModal for confessions
  - Proper event handling to prevent navigation conflicts

- **SecretDetailScreen** (`src/screens/SecretDetailScreen.tsx`):
  - Added report button for confessions
  - Added report buttons for individual replies
  - Integrated ReportModal for both content types

- **ShareModal** (`src/components/ShareModal.tsx`):
  - Updated to use new backend functionality
  - Replaced alert-only reporting with database integration

- **EnhancedShareBottomSheet** (`src/components/EnhancedShareBottomSheet.tsx`):
  - Updated to use new backend functionality
  - Integrated with ReportModal

### 6. Testing Utilities
- **File**: `src/utils/testReportSystem.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Automated testing functions
  - Setup verification
  - Status checking utilities

## ðŸ”§ Easy Setup Process

### Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)
Use the MigrationHelper component for easy setup:

1. **Add the helper component temporarily to your app**:
   ```typescript
   // In App.tsx or any screen
   import MigrationHelper from './src/components/MigrationHelper';

   // Add this to your render:
   <MigrationHelper />
   ```

2. **Tap "Setup Reports Table" button** in the app
3. **Remove the MigrationHelper component** after setup is complete

### Option 2: Manual Setup
If automatic setup doesn't work:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xhtqobjcbjgzxkgfyvdj/sql
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Create a new query
4. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/reports-migration.sql`
5. Run the query

### 3. Test the Implementation
After setup, test the system:

```typescript
import { testReportSystem } from './src/utils/testReportSystem';

// This will automatically verify everything works
testReportSystem();
```

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### User Flow
1. User sees a flag icon next to like/comment buttons on secrets
2. User taps the flag icon
3. ReportModal opens with reason selection
4. User selects a reason and optionally adds details
5. User submits the report
6. Report is saved to Supabase database
7. Success message is shown

### Report Reasons
- Inappropriate Content
- Spam
- Harassment
- False Information
- Violence
- Hate Speech
- Other (with required details)

### Security Features
- Row Level Security ensures users can only see their own reports
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate reports from the same user
- Proper foreign key relationships maintain data integrity
- Input validation on both client and database level

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migration in Supabase
- [ ] Verify reports table exists
- [ ] Test report button appears on HomeScreen
- [ ] Test report button appears on SecretDetailScreen
- [ ] Test report button appears on replies
- [ ] Test ReportModal opens and closes properly
- [ ] Test report reason selection
- [ ] Test report submission
- [ ] Verify reports are saved to database
- [ ] Test duplicate report prevention
- [ ] Test error handling

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

- Reports are anonymous but tracked by user ID for abuse prevention
- RLS policies prevent users from seeing others' reports
- Database constraints prevent invalid data
- Client-side validation provides immediate feedback
- Server-side validation ensures data integrity

## ðŸ“± UI/UX Features

- Consistent flag icon across all screens
- Haptic feedback on interactions
- Smooth modal animations
- Form validation with clear error messages
- Success feedback after submission
- Prevents accidental navigation when reporting

The report system is now fully implemented and ready for use once the database migration is run!
