# Can You Disable New Architecture on Expo SDK 54?

## Short Answer: NO ‚ùå

**Expo SDK 54 enforces New Architecture.** You cannot disable it while staying on SDK 54.

## Why Expo 54 Requires New Architecture

### From Expo's Documentation:

Starting with Expo SDK 51+ (including SDK 54):
- **New Architecture is the default**
- **Cannot be fully disabled**
- All apps are compiled with New Architecture support
- This is by design for future compatibility

### Technical Reality

```javascript
// app.config.js - Expo SDK 54
export default {
  expo: {
    newArchEnabled: false, // ‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS IGNORED on SDK 54
  }
}
```

Even if you set `newArchEnabled: false`, Expo SDK 54 still compiles with New Architecture dependencies. The Skia Canvas incompatibility remains.

## Your ONLY Options with Expo SDK 54

### Option 1: Keep SDK 54, Remove Face Blur ‚úÖ
**What:**
- Stay on Expo 54 + RN 0.81.4
- Remove face blur feature
- Ship app with other features

**Time:** 30 minutes
**Cost:** $0
**Face Blur:** NO

---

### Option 2: Keep SDK 54, Build Native Modules üî®
**What:**
- Stay on Expo 54 + RN 0.81.4
- Build custom Swift + Kotlin modules
- Native face blur implementation

**Time:** 2-4 weeks
**Cost:** $5,000-10,000
**Face Blur:** YES (real-time)

---

### Option 3: Downgrade to Expo SDK 50 ‚ö†Ô∏è
**What:**
- Downgrade to Expo SDK 50
- Downgrade to RN 0.73.6
- Disable New Architecture
- Use FaceBlurApp approach

**Time:** 2-4 hours
**Cost:** $0
**Face Blur:** YES (real-time)

**But:** Can't use SDK 54 features

## SDK 54 vs SDK 50 Feature Comparison

### What You'd Lose by Downgrading to SDK 50

| Feature | SDK 50 | SDK 54 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **React Native** | 0.73.6 | 0.81.4 |
| **New Architecture** | Optional | Required |
| **expo-router** | v3.4 | v4.0 |
| **expo-video** | Experimental | Stable |
| **Android API** | 34 | 35 |
| **iOS SDK** | 17.0 | 18.0 |
| **Hermes** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Expo Go** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

### Key SDK 54 Features You'd Miss

1. **expo-video improvements**
   - Better performance
   - More features
   - Stable API

2. **expo-router v4**
   - Better navigation
   - Improved layouts
   - New features

3. **Latest Android/iOS SDKs**
   - Android 15 support
   - iOS 18 features

4. **Performance improvements**
   - Better bridgeless mode
   - Improved TurboModules

### SDK 50 Still Gets You

- ‚úÖ All core Expo features
- ‚úÖ Navigation (expo-router v3)
- ‚úÖ Video playback (stable)
- ‚úÖ All your current dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Working face blur**

---

## Why Expo Moved to Mandatory New Architecture

### Expo's Reasoning:

1. **Future-proofing**
   - New Architecture is React Native's future
   - Old bridge is deprecated
   - Better to migrate now

2. **Performance**
   - TurboModules are faster
   - Better memory management
   - Improved startup time

3. **Consistency**
   - All apps use same architecture
   - Easier to support
   - Better ecosystem alignment

**But:** This broke Skia frame processors for face blur.

## Can We "Hack" SDK 54 to Disable New Arch?

### Attempted Workarounds:

**1. Set newArchEnabled: false everywhere**
```javascript
// app.config.js
export default {
  expo: {
    newArchEnabled: false,
    android: { newArchEnabled: false },
    ios: { newArchEnabled: false },
  }
}
```
**Result:** ‚ùå Doesn't work - SDK 54 ignores this

**2. Use development builds with custom config**
```javascript
// metro.config.js
module.exports = {
  transformer: {
    unstable_disableNewArchitecture: true // ‚ùå Not a real option
  }
}
```
**Result:** ‚ùå This option doesn't exist

**3. Manually edit native code**
```objective-c
// ios/Podfile
ENV['RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED'] = '0' // ‚ùå Conflicts with Expo
```
**Result:** ‚ùå Breaks Expo prebuild

**4. Fork Expo SDK**
- Modify SDK 54 to disable New Arch
- Maintain your own fork
**Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible but insane amount of work

## The Decision Matrix

### If Face Blur is CRITICAL:

**You MUST choose:**

| Priority | Solution | Time | Cost |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| **Need SDK 54 features** | Build native modules | 2-4 weeks | $5k-10k |
| **Need face blur NOW** | Downgrade to SDK 50 | 2-4 hours | $0 |
| **Ship app ASAP** | Remove face blur | 30 min | $0 |

### If Face Blur is NICE-TO-HAVE:

**Best choice:** Remove feature, stay on SDK 54, add later

---

## My Honest Assessment

### You Have 3 Real Options:

**1. Stay on SDK 54, No Face Blur** ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
- Keep latest Expo
- Ship app quickly
- Add face blur later with native modules
- **Time:** 30 minutes

**2. Downgrade to SDK 50, Get Face Blur** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Lose SDK 54 features
- Face blur works immediately
- Upgrade later
- **Time:** 2-4 hours

**3. Stay on SDK 54, Build Native** üí∞
- Keep latest Expo
- Get face blur
- Expensive and time-consuming
- **Time:** 2-4 weeks, $5k-10k

## What SDK 54 Features Are You Using?

**Check if you actually need SDK 54:**

```bash
# Search for SDK 54-specific features
grep -r "expo-video" src/
grep -r "expo-router" app/
# etc.
```

**If you're NOT using:**
- Latest expo-video features
- expo-router v4 features
- Android 15 / iOS 18 specific features

**Then downgrading to SDK 50 might not hurt you.**

---

## Final Recommendations

### Scenario A: You NEED SDK 54 Features

**Stay on SDK 54, choose:**
- Remove face blur (30 min) - Ship now
- OR build native modules (weeks, $$$) - Ship later

### Scenario B: You DON'T Need SDK 54 Features

**Downgrade to SDK 50:**
- Takes 2-4 hours
- Face blur works
- Ship this week
- Upgrade later when Skia supports New Arch

### Scenario C: Unsure

**Ask yourself:**
1. What specific SDK 54 features am I using?
2. Are they critical to the app?
3. Can I wait to add them later?

**If answers are vague:** You probably don't need SDK 54 specifically.

## The Bottom Line

**You CANNOT have:**
- ‚úÖ Expo SDK 54
- ‚úÖ New Architecture disabled
- ‚úÖ Skia face blur working

**You MUST compromise on ONE:**
- Drop SDK 54 (‚Üí SDK 50)
- Drop face blur
- Drop Skia approach (‚Üí native modules)

**There is no fourth option.**

---

## What Do You Want?

**Tell me your priority:**

A. **SDK 54 is required** ‚Üí Remove face blur or build native
B. **Face blur is required** ‚Üí Downgrade to SDK 50
C. **Both are required** ‚Üí Build native modules ($$$)

Then I can help you implement the best solution.
