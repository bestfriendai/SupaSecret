# RevenueCat Integration - FIXED ‚úÖ

**Status:** Production Ready
**Date:** September 29, 2025

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Production API Keys Updated
**File:** `eas.json` lines 109-110

**Before:**
```json
"EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_KEY": "appl_test_revenuecat_ios_key",
"EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_ANDROID_KEY": "goog_test_revenuecat_android_key"
```

**After:**
```json
"EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_KEY": "appl_nXnAuBEeeERxBHxAzqhFgSnIzam",
"EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_ANDROID_KEY": "goog_ffsiomTRezyIrsyrwwZTiCpjSiC"
```

**Impact:** Production builds will now use real RevenueCat API keys and can process actual purchases.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Offerings Validation Added
**File:** `src/services/RevenueCatService.ts` lines 218-255

**Added comprehensive validation:**
- Checks if offerings are empty
- Validates current offering exists
- Verifies packages are available
- Logs detailed debugging information
- Provides actionable error messages for both dev and production

**Development Mode Warnings:**
```
üí° Check: App Store Connect products have all metadata
üí° Check: RevenueCat product IDs match exactly
üí° Check: Paid Applications Agreement signed
```

**Production Mode Alerts:**
```
üö® PRODUCTION: No offerings available!
üö® Users will not be able to purchase subscriptions
üö® Verify: Products are 'Ready to Submit' in App Store Connect
```

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Removed Firebase/AI Test Keys
**File:** `eas.json` production profile

**Removed (no longer needed):**
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` keys (Firebase removed from project)
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` (not needed for MVP)
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (not needed for MVP)
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_GROK_API_KEY` (not needed for MVP)
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` (not needed)

**Benefit:** Cleaner production config, only essential keys remain.
