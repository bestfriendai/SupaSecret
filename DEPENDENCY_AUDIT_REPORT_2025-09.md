### Moderate Vulnerabilities (6 found)

**React Native Voice Package**
- `@react-native-voice/voice` 3.2.4: Affected by transitive dependencies
- **Fix**: Downgrade to 3.1.5 (breaking change - requires testing)

**Markdown Processing**
- `markdown-it` (CVE-2024-51498): Uncontrolled resource consumption
- **Risk Level**: MODERATE - DoS potential in markdown rendering
- **Fix**: Update `react-native-markdown-display` (no fix available currently)

### Low Vulnerabilities (2 found)

**Development Dependencies**
- `tmp` package: Symbolic link vulnerability (build-time only)
- `patch-package`: Affected by tmp vulnerability
- **Risk Level**: LOW - Development environment only

## Dependency Version Analysis

### Critical Upgrades Needed

| Package | Current | Latest | Priority | Breaking Changes |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|------------------|
| `react-native-vision-camera` | 4.0.0-beta.13 | 4.7.2 | CRITICAL | API changes |
| `@react-native-firebase/analytics` | 19.2.2 | 23.3.1 | HIGH | Major version |
| `@react-native-firebase/crashlytics` | 19.2.2 | 23.3.1 | HIGH | Major version |
| `@sentry/react-native` | 6.20.0 | 8.40.0 | HIGH | Major version |
| `@react-native-voice/voice` | 3.2.4 | 3.1.5 | HIGH | Downgrade needed |

### Expo SDK 54 Compatibility Status

✅ **Compatible Dependencies**
- All Expo modules are at correct versions for SDK 54
- React Navigation v7 packages properly updated
- React 19.1.0 and React Native 0.81.4 aligned

⚠️ **Requires Attention**
- Custom patches may conflict with current versions
- Some native modules need development build testing
- TypeScript compilation errors need resolution

## Native Module Compatibility Matrix

### Development Build Required
- `@react-native-firebase/*` - Native Firebase SDK
- `react-native-google-mobile-ads` - Native AdMob SDK  
- `react-native-vision-camera` - Camera native module
- `ffmpeg-kit-react-native` - Native FFmpeg binaries
- `react-native-mmkv` - Native storage
- `@react-native-voice/voice` - Native speech recognition
- `react-native-video-processing` - Native video processing
- `@react-native-ml-kit/face-detection` - Native ML Kit

### Expo Go Compatible
- All Expo SDK modules
- React Navigation packages
- JavaScript-only dependencies (Zustand, date-fns, etc.)

## Custom Patches Assessment

### react-native@0.79.2.patch
**Status**: ⚠️ LIKELY OBSOLETE
- Patches React Native 0.79.2 but project uses 0.81.4
- Modifications: LogBox, ExceptionsManager, RedBox, networking
- **Recommendation**: Test removal - many fixes may be incorporated in 0.81.4

### expo-asset@11.1.5.patch  
**Status**: ⚠️ LIKELY OBSOLETE
- Patches expo-asset 11.1.5 but project uses ~12.0.8
- Custom VibecodeExpoModule integration
- **Recommendation**: Update patch for current version or implement alternative

## Breaking Changes Documentation

### React Navigation v7 (Already Updated, Not Implemented)
- Navigation state structure changes
- New Navigation ID system required
- TypeScript type updates needed
- Files requiring updates: `src/navigation/*`, `src/screens/*`

### Firebase SDK 19.x → 23.x
- Analytics API changes
- Crashlytics configuration updates
- Native iOS/Android configuration changes
- New Firebase features available

### Vision Camera beta → stable
- API stabilization changes
- Performance improvements
- Bug fixes from beta releases

## Prioritized Action Plan

### Level 1: Critical Security Fixes (1-2 weeks)
