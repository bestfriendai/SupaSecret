## Detailed Migration Plan: Downgrade to RN 0.73.x

### Step 1: Check Package Compatibility

**Your Key Dependencies:**
```json
{
  "react-native-vision-camera": "^4.6.5", // ✅ Supports 0.73
  "@shopify/react-native-skia": "^2.2.12", // ✅ Supports 0.73
  "@react-native-ml-kit/face-detection": "^2.0.1", // ✅ Supports 0.73
  "react-native-reanimated": "~4.0.0", // ⚠️ May need downgrade
  "@react-navigation/native": "^7.0.17" // ✅ Supports 0.73
}
```

### Step 2: Update package.json

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "~50.0.17",
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-native": "0.73.6",
    "react-native-reanimated": "~3.6.0", // Downgrade
    
    // Keep these as-is (they support 0.73)
    "react-native-vision-camera": "^4.6.5",
    "@shopify/react-native-skia": "^2.2.12",
    "@react-native-ml-kit/face-detection": "^2.0.1"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Update app.config.js

```javascript
export default {
  expo: {
    // ... existing config
    plugins: [
      // ... existing plugins
    ],
    
    // IMPORTANT: Disable New Architecture
    android: {
      newArchEnabled: false, // ← Add this
    },
    ios: {
      newArchEnabled: false, // ← Add this
    }
  }
};
```

### Step 4: Clean Rebuild

```bash
# 1. Remove dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# 2. Clean Expo
rm -rf .expo

# 3. Clean iOS
cd ios && rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock build && cd ..

# 4. Reinstall
npm install

# 5. Reinstall iOS pods
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# 6. Rebuild
npx expo prebuild --clean

# 7. Run
npx expo run:ios
```

### Step 5: Enable Face Blur

```typescript
// Now FaceBlurApp approach works!
const frameProcessor = useSkiaFrameProcessor(frame => {
   'worklet';
   frame.render();
   
   const {faces} = detectFaces({frame});
   
   for (const face of faces) {
      // ... blur logic from FaceBlurApp
      frame.save();
      frame.clipPath(path, ClipOp.Intersect, true);
      frame.render(paint);
      frame.restore();
   }
}, []);
```

**No more Canvas onLayout error!**

## Trade-offs Comparison

### Staying on RN 0.81.4 (Current)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Latest features
- ✅ Best performance
- ✅ Future-proof
- ✅ New Architecture benefits

**Cons:**
- ❌ Face blur impossible (Skia conflict)
- ❌ Need native modules ($5k-10k)

**Best for:** Apps that don't need face blur

---

### Downgrading to RN 0.73.x

**Pros:**
- ✅ Face blur works (FaceBlurApp approach)
- ✅ Still reasonably modern (1 year old)
- ✅ Stable and tested
- ✅ Ship quickly

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Missing latest RN features
- ⚠️ Will need to upgrade later
- ⚠️ 2-4 hours migration work

**Best for:** Apps that NEED face blur NOW

---

## What You'll Lose by Downgrading

### Features Available in 0.74+
- New Yoga layout engine improvements
- Better bridgeless mode
- Improved TurboModules
- Performance improvements

### But You'll Gain
- ✅ Working face blur
- ✅ Ship app faster
- ✅ No need for native modules

## What I Recommend

### If Face Blur is CRITICAL: Downgrade to 0.73.x

**Timeline:**
- 2-4 hours to migrate
- Face blur works immediately
- Ship app this week

**Cost:** 
- $0
- Just developer time

**Long-term:**
- Upgrade to newer RN when:
  - Skia adds New Arch support
  - You have budget for native modules
  - Alternative solution emerges

---

### If Face Blur is NICE-TO-HAVE: Stay on 0.81.4

**Timeline:**
- 30 min to remove feature
- Ship app today

**Cost:**
- $0 now
- Maybe $5k-10k later for native modules

**Long-term:**
- App is future-proof
- Add face blur when budget allows

---

## Migration Commands

### To Downgrade to RN 0.73.x

```bash
# 1. Update package.json to use Expo 50
npm install expo@~50.0.17 react@18.2.0 react-native@0.73.6

# 2. Downgrade Reanimated
npm install react-native-reanimated@~3.6.0

# 3. Update app.config.js
# Add newArchEnabled: false (see Step 3 above)

# 4. Clean everything
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .expo ios/Pods ios/Podfile.lock

# 5. Reinstall
npm install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# 6. Prebuild
npx expo prebuild --clean

# 7. Test
npx expo run:ios
```

### Expected Time
- Migration: 2-4 hours
- Testing: 1-2 hours
- **Total: Half a day**

## My Final Recommendation

### For You Specifically

**I recommend: Downgrade to RN 0.73.x + Expo SDK 50**

**Why:**
1. You've spent days trying to make face blur work
2. It's clearly an important feature for your app
3. 2-4 hours downgrade vs weeks of native development
4. RN 0.73 is still modern and stable
5. You can upgrade later when Skia supports New Arch

**Steps:**
1. Downgrade to RN 0.73.x (2-4 hours)
2. Copy FaceBlurApp approach (30 min)
3. Test face blur (1 hour)
4. Ship app (done!)

**This gets you:**
- ✅ Working face blur
- ✅ Ship this week
- ✅ $0 cost
- ⚠️ Slightly older RN (acceptable trade-off)

## Alternative: Remove Feature

If you decide face blur isn't worth the downgrade:
1. Remove feature (30 min)
2. Ship on RN 0.81.4
3. Add later with native modules

**Your call!**
