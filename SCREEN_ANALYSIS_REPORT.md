## Summary of Findings

### Critical Issues (None)
No critical issues were identified that would prevent the app from functioning properly.

### High Priority Issues
1. **Video Recording Performance:** The video recording screens, particularly FaceBlurRecordScreen and VisionCameraRecordScreen, have complex implementations that could impact performance and cause memory leaks.
2. **Video Processing Error Handling:** VideoPreviewScreen and video recording screens need more robust error handling for video processing failures.

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **State Management Complexity:** Some screens have complex state management that could be simplified.
2. **Memory Leak Potential:** Several screens, particularly those dealing with video processing, have potential memory leaks.

### Low Priority Issues
1. **Code Optimization:** Some screens could benefit from code optimization and refactoring.
2. **Accessibility Improvements:** While most screens have good accessibility, some could be improved.

## Recommendations

1. **Optimize Video Recording Performance:**
   - Implement proper cleanup for frame processors
   - Add memory monitoring for video recording
   - Simplify conditional rendering paths

2. **Improve Error Handling:**
   - Add comprehensive error handling for video processing
   - Implement user-friendly error messages
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed operations

3. **Simplify State Management:**
   - Consider using state management libraries for complex screens
   - Implement proper cleanup for unmounted components
   - Add memory leak detection

4. **Enhance Testing:**
   - Add unit tests for critical components
   - Implement integration tests for video recording
   - Add performance testing for video processing

## Conclusion

The app is well-implemented with good code quality and proper error handling in most screens. The main areas of concern are the video recording and processing screens, which have complex implementations that could impact performance and cause memory leaks. With the recommended improvements, the app should provide a smooth and reliable user experience.
