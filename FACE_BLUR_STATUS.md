# Face Blur Status - Not Working

## Current Status: ‚ùå DISABLED

Face blur feature has been **disabled** to keep video recording working.

## What Works ‚úÖ

- **Video recording** - Works perfectly without face blur
- **Camera switching** - Front/back camera toggle works
- **Video preview and upload** - All functional
- **60 second recording** - No crashes or freezes

## What Doesn't Work ‚ùå

- **Face blur frame processor** - Causes recording to freeze/stop after ~2 seconds
- Any `frameProcessor` on the Camera component breaks recording

## Technical Issue

The `useSkiaFrameProcessor` with `detectFaces` is fundamentally broken in this environment:

1. **Without frame processor**: Recording works perfectly ‚úÖ
2. **With ANY frame processor**: Recording stops after 2 seconds ‚ùå

Even with all safety checks, try-catch, and null guards, adding `frameProcessor={...}` to the Camera breaks recording.

## Root Cause

Unknown. Possibilities:
1. **VisionCamera version incompatibility** with react-native-vision-camera-face-detector
2. **Worklets threading issue** - frame processor crashes recording thread
3. **New Architecture disabled** - frame processors may require New Architecture
4. **iOS simulator issue** - may work on physical device (untested)

## Attempted Fixes (All Failed)

1. ‚úÖ Fixed Rules of Hooks violations
2. ‚úÖ Added proper error handling
3. ‚úÖ Made paint stable with useMemo
4. ‚úÖ Matched FaceBlurApp implementation exactly
5. ‚úÖ Validated all dependencies installed
6. ‚úÖ Rebuilt native code multiple times
7. ‚ùå **None prevented the freeze**

## Recommendation

**Keep face blur disabled** until further investigation:

### Option 1: Server-side blur (Recommended)
Upload video to Supabase, blur on server, store processed version

### Option 2: Post-processing
Record without blur, process with ffmpeg after recording

### Option 3: Debug on physical device
Test if frame processor works on real iPhone (not simulator)

### Option 4: Upgrade to New Architecture
Enable New Architecture and test if frame processors work better

### Option 5: Alternative library
Use different face detection library compatible with current setup

## Files Modified

- `src/screens/FaceBlurRecordScreen.tsx` - Frame processor removed, UI updated
- `src/hooks/useVisionCameraRecorder.ts` - Fixed but not in use
- Multiple documentation files created during debugging

## For Future Implementation

If attempting to re-enable face blur:

1. Test on **physical device first**, not simulator
2. Check VisionCamera + face-detector version compatibility
3. Consider enabling New Architecture
4. Start with simple frame processor (no face detection) to verify basic FP works
5. Add face detection incrementally

## Current User Experience

Users can:
- ‚úÖ Record video confessions
- ‚úÖ Upload to Supabase
- ‚ùå Cannot blur faces in real-time
- üîÑ Could add server-side blur as future enhancement
