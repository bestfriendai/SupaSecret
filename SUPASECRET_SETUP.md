## 🛠 Supabase Backend Setup (Required for Video Uploads)

Run the SQL script at `supabase/setup.sql` in your Supabase project (SQL Editor → New query → paste → Run):

- Creates private storage bucket `confessions`
- Adds storage RLS so users can only write under `videos/{auth.uid()}/...`
- Enables RLS and policies on all app tables
- Adds unique constraints for likes and performance indices
- Creates `public_confessions` view (safe columns)
- Adds `toggle_confession_like` RPC to prevent like races and keep counts consistent

After this, ensure your `.env` has valid `EXPO_PUBLIC_VIBECODE_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_VIBECODE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and test:

1) Sign in → record a video → observe “Uploading video to secure storage…” progress → success toast
2) Open “Videos” tab → play the freshly uploaded video (signed URL)
3) Toggle like on any confession → count updates reliably
