üöÄ Deployment Process

Step 1: Final Configuration Validation
1. Run production configuration validation script
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test production build locally
4. Verify all third-party services are configured

Step 2: Build Production Binaries
1. Create production build with EAS:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform all --profile production
   ```
2. Download and test production binaries
3. Verify app functionality in production mode
4. Test on physical devices

Step 3: App Store Submission
1. iOS Submission

   - Complete app review information
   - Submit for review
   - Monitor review status

2. Android Submission
   - Upload to Google Play Console
   - Complete store listing
   - Submit for review
   - Monitor review status

Step 4: Post-Deployment Monitoring
1. Monitor crash reports and analytics
2. Watch for user feedback and reviews
3. Monitor API usage and costs
4. Check performance metrics
