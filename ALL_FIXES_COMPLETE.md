## 🚀 **Video Anonymization Features**

### **TikTok-Style Captions** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
Videos now have **real-time captions** that appear as users speak:
- Words appear 2-4 at a time, synchronized with speech
- Professional white text with black outline  
- Burned directly into video file
- Example: `"This is my"` → `"secret confession"` → `"about something"`

### **Dual-Mode Architecture** ✅ WORKING
- **Expo Go**: Demo mode with simulated features (perfect for testing)
- **Development Build**: Full native processing with ML Kit + FFmpeg

### **Complete Anonymization Pipeline** ✅ READY
1. **Face Detection** - ML Kit scanning every 30th frame
2. **Face Blurring** - FFmpeg Gaussian blur on detected regions  
3. **Voice Modification** - Real pitch shifting (deep/light effects)
4. **Speech Recognition** - Native platform STT APIs
5. **Caption Overlay** - Timed text burned into video
6. **Final Upload** - Fully anonymized confession video

5. **Share Anonymously** - Upload to server completely anonymized

### **Final Video Output**
- ✅ **Blurred Face** - ML Kit detection + FFmpeg blur

## 🔬 **Technical Architecture**

### **Environment Detection**
```typescript
if (env.expoGo) {
  // Uses DemoAnonymiser (simulation)
  console.log("🎯 Demo mode - perfect for testing")
} else {
  // Uses NativeAnonymiser (real ML Kit + FFmpeg)  
  console.log("🚀 Full native processing")
}
```

### **Error Handling**
- Graceful fallbacks for all native features
- Full-frame blur when face detection fails
- Alternative codecs when FFmpeg errors occur
- Mock transcription when STT unavailable

### **Performance Optimized**
- 720p processing to prevent memory issues
- Sparse frame sampling (every 30th frame)
- Fast FFmpeg presets for real-time performance
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files
