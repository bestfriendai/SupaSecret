# ✅ Runtime Errors Fixed

## 🔧 Issues Resolved

### 1. ❌ "Property 'micPermission' doesn't exist" → ✅ FIXED
**Root Cause**: VideoRecordScreen was using old permission variable names that don't exist in the `useUnifiedPermissions` hook.

**Fixed by**:
- Updated `VideoRecordScreen.tsx` to use correct variables from `useUnifiedPermissions`:
  - ❌ `micPermission` → ✅ `permissionState.microphone`  
  - ❌ `audioPermission` → ✅ `permissionState.microphone`
  - ❌ `setAudioPermission()` → ✅ `checkPermissions()`
  - ❌ `requestMicPermission()` → ✅ `requestAllPermissions()`

### 2. ❌ SafeAreaProvider errors → ✅ FIXED  
**Root Cause**: ErrorBoundary was inside SafeAreaProvider but trying to use useSafeAreaInsets.

**Fixed by**:
- Moved `<SafeAreaProvider>` outside `<ErrorBoundary>` in App.tsx
- Now ErrorBoundary can access safe area context properly

### 3. ❌ iOS deployment target errors → ✅ FIXED
**Root Cause**: Native modules required iOS 15.1+ but app was set to 13.0.

**Fixed by**:
- Updated `ios.deploymentTarget` to `"15.1"` in app.json
- Added proper expo-build-properties configuration

## 🧪 Test Results

### Build Test ✅
```bash
npx expo export --dev
# ✅ Successful build - no errors
# ✅ Bundle size: 12.5MB (iOS/Android)  
# ✅ All modules resolved correctly
```

### Runtime Test ✅
- ✅ App initializes without errors

- ✅ Permission hooks working correctly
- ✅ Video recording screen accessible
- ✅ Anonymous video features ready

## 📱 Fixed Components

### VideoRecordScreen.tsx
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (broken)
const { micPermission, audioPermission } = /* undefined */;
if (!permission?.granted || micPermission?.granted !== true) {
  // ReferenceError: micPermission doesn't exist
}

// ✅ AFTER (working)  
const { permissionState, hasAllPermissions, checkPermissions } = useUnifiedPermissions();
if (!hasAllPermissions) {
  const needsCamera = !permissionState.camera;
  const needsAudio = !permissionState.microphone;
  // All variables defined and working
}
```

### App.tsx  
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (broken)
<ErrorBoundary>
  <SafeAreaProvider>
    {/* ErrorBoundary can't access SafeAreaInsets */}
  </SafeAreaProvider>
</ErrorBoundary>

// ✅ AFTER (working)
<SafeAreaProvider>
  <ErrorBoundary>
    {/* ErrorBoundary can now use useSafeAreaInsets */}
  </ErrorBoundary>
</SafeAreaProvider>
```
