# üöÄ Toxic Confessions - Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Verification

### Core Implementation Status
- [x] **Video Pipeline**: Secure end-to-end processing implemented
- [x] **Database Migration**: 3 legacy records migrated (`videos/` ‚Üí `confessions/`)
- [x] **Code Consistency**: All paths use "confessions" bucket
- [x] **Production Logging**: Non-critical logs gated behind `__DEV__`
- [x] **TypeScript**: Compilation passes with 0 errors
- [x] **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites available
- [x] **Branding**: Complete rebrand to "Toxic Confessions"
- [x] **Configuration**: App metadata and IDs updated

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Run complete implementation check
npm run complete-implementation

# Verify TypeScript compilation
npm run typecheck

# Test video pipeline (in development)
# Import and run: runCompleteVideoTests() from videoTestRunner.ts
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Required Manual Actions

### 1. Complete Storage Migration
**Status**: Pending - requires service role key

**Steps**:
1. Add service role key to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   SUPABASE_URL=https://xhtqobjcbjgzxkgfyvdj.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ```

2. Run storage migration:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:copy-storage
   ```

3. Verify 3 video files copied successfully

### 2. Test Video Playback
**Steps**:
1. Build and run the app on device/simulator
2. Navigate to videos that were migrated
3. Verify videos play correctly with signed URLs
4. Test new video uploads use "confessions" bucket

### 3. Run End-to-End Tests
**Steps**:
1. In development build, import test utilities:
   ```typescript
   import { runCompleteVideoTests } from './src/utils/videoTestRunner';
   const results = await runCompleteVideoTests();
   ```

2. Verify all tests pass
3. Check smoke test results for any issues

## üîß Production Configuration

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in production:

**Required**:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

**Optional (for full features)**:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_KEY`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_ANDROID_KEY`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMOB_*` (various AdMob IDs)
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID` (for push notifications)

### Build Configuration
- **iOS Bundle ID**: `com.toxic.confessions`
- **Android Package**: `com.toxic.confessions`
- **App Name**: "Toxic Confessions"
- **URL Scheme**: `toxicconfessions://`

## üì± Platform-Specific Checks

- [ ] AdMob iOS app ID configured (if using ads)

### Android
- [ ] Package name updated in app.json
- [ ] Permissions configured correctly
- [ ] RevenueCat Android API key configured (if using subscriptions)
- [ ] AdMob Android app ID configured (if using ads)

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Video Pipeline Tests
- [ ] Signed URL generation works
- [ ] Edge Function responds correctly
- [ ] Database constraints enforced
- [ ] Bucket consistency maintained
- [ ] Upload/processing/playback flow works end-to-end

### App Functionality Tests
- [ ] User authentication works
- [ ] Video recording and upload
- [ ] Video playback with signed URLs
- [ ] Text confessions
- [ ] Like/unlike functionality
- [ ] Profile management
- [ ] Settings persistence

### Performance Tests
- [ ] App startup time acceptable
- [ ] Video loading performance
- [ ] Memory usage during video processing
- [ ] Network usage optimization

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Build
```bash
# Final verification
npm run complete-implementation

# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

# Type check
npm run typecheck
```

### 2. Build
```bash
# Development build
eas build --profile development

# Production build
eas build --profile production
```

### 3. Testing
- Test development build thoroughly
- Run all video pipeline tests
- Verify storage migration completed
- Test on multiple devices/OS versions

### 4. Production Deploy
```bash
# Submit to app stores
eas submit --profile production
```

## üìä Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] 0 TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] All video pipeline tests pass
- [ ] Storage migration 100% complete
- [ ] App startup time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Video processing success rate > 95%

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] Video upload success rate > 98%
- [ ] Video playback success rate > 99%
- [ ] App crash rate < 0.1%
- [ ] User retention after video feature usage

## üîÑ Post-Deployment

### Monitoring
- Monitor video processing success rates
- Track signed URL generation performance
- Watch for any storage-related errors
- Monitor app store reviews for video issues

### Cleanup (After 2+ weeks)
- Remove legacy "videos" bucket if all videos migrated successfully
- Clean up any temporary migration scripts
- Archive old documentation versions

## üìû Support

### If Issues Arise
1. Check video pipeline smoke tests first
2. Verify storage migration completed successfully
3. Check Supabase logs for Edge Function errors
4. Review signed URL generation for expired tokens
5. Validate RLS policies are working correctly

### Key Files for Debugging
- `src/utils/storage.ts` - Video storage and signed URLs
- `src/state/confessionStore.ts` - Video data persistence
- `supabase/functions/process-video/index.ts` - Server-side processing
- `src/utils/videoTestRunner.ts` - Comprehensive testing
