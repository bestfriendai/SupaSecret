## Critical Issues

### 1. React Hook Rule Violations (Critical)

**Location**: `src/hooks/useScreenStatus.ts` (lines 168-180)

**Issue**: Conditional hook usage inside a loop violates React Hook rules.

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
operations.forEach((operation) => {
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/rules-of-hooks
  statuses[operation] = useScreenStatus({
    screenName: `${screenName}_${operation}`,
    enableRetry: true,
  });
});
```

**Impact**: This will cause unpredictable behavior and runtime errors.

**Recommendation**: Refactor to use a single hook that manages multiple operations or restructure the component to avoid conditional hooks.

### 2. Memory Leaks in Video Processing (High Priority)

**Location**: `src/hooks/useSimpleFaceBlur.ts` and `src/hooks/useVideoPerformanceOptimization.ts`

**Issue**: Frame processors and intervals not properly cleaned up when components unmount.

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor(
  (frame: any) => {
    // Processing logic
  },
  [detectFaces, isAvailable, enabled, useFrameProcessor],
);
// Missing cleanup in useEffect
```

**Impact**: Memory leaks as processors continue running after unmount.

**Recommendation**: Add proper cleanup in useEffect for all frame processors and intervals.

### 3. Performance Issues in Video Recording (High Priority)

**Location**: `src/screens/FaceBlurRecordScreen.tsx`, `src/screens/VisionCameraRecordScreen.tsx`

**Issue**: Complex real-time video processing impacts performance.

- Heavy use of worklets and frame processors
- Multiple rendering paths based on conditions
- Inefficient state management for video processing

**Impact**: Poor user experience, potential crashes on lower-end devices.

**Recommendation**: Optimize frame processing, consolidate rendering paths, and improve state management.

### 4. Error Handling Deficiencies (Medium Priority)

**Location**: `src/hooks/useCaptionGeneration.ts`, `src/hooks/useSpeechRecognition.ts`

**Issue**: Inadequate error handling and UI feedback in hooks.

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
Alert.alert("Caption Error", errorMessage); // Should not be in a hook
```

**Impact**: Reduced error visibility and poor user experience.

**Recommendation**: Return error states from hooks and let components handle UI feedback.

  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/rules-of-hooks
  statuses[operation] = useScreenStatus({
    screenName: `${screenName}_${operation}`,
    enableRetry: true,
  });
});
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```typescript
// src/hooks/useScreenStatus.ts
// Use a single hook to manage all operations
const statuses = useMultipleScreenStatus({
  operations,
  screenName,
  enableRetry: true,
});
```

**Before (Problematic)**:
```typescript
// src/hooks/useSimpleFaceBlur.ts
const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor(
  (frame: any) => {
    // Processing logic
  },
  [detectFaces, isAvailable, enabled, useFrameProcessor],
);
// Missing cleanup
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```typescript
// src/hooks/useSimpleFaceBlur.ts
const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor(
  (frame: any) => {
    // Processing logic
  },
  [detectFaces, isAvailable, enabled, useFrameProcessor],
);

useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    // Cleanup frame processor
    if (frameProcessor) {
      frameProcessor.remove();
    }
  };
}, []);
```

### Example 3: Error Handling Fix in Hooks

**Before (Problematic)**:
```typescript
// src/hooks/useCaptionGeneration.ts
const generateCaption = async () => {
  try {
    // API call
  } catch (error) {
    Alert.alert("Caption Error", errorMessage); // Should not be in hook
  }
};
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```typescript
// src/hooks/useCaptionGeneration.ts
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

const generateCaption = async () => {
  try {
    // API call
  } catch (error) {
    setError(errorMessage); // Return error state
  }
};

return { caption, error, generateCaption };
```
