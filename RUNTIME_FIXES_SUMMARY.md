# Runtime Issues Fixed - Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Babel Plugin Error**
```
ERROR: Cannot find module 'react-native-worklets/plugin'
```
**Cause**: Missing `react-native-worklets` package

### 2. **Runtime HostFunction Error**
```
ERROR: Exception in HostFunction: <unknown>
ERROR: Invariant Violation: "main" has not been registered
```
**Cause**: 
- `react-native-worklets-core` was being imported but requires New Architecture (not enabled)
- `react-native-reanimated` native module linking issues

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Disabled Worklets Core
**Files Modified:**
- `index.ts` - Commented out `import "react-native-worklets-core"`
- `babel.config.js` - Commented out `"react-native-worklets-core/plugin"`

**Reason**: Worklets require the New Architecture which is not enabled in this project.

### 2. Lazy Loading for Vision Camera Components
**File Modified:** `src/screens/VideoRecordScreen.tsx`

**Change**: Converted `FaceBlurRecordScreen` import from static to lazy loading:
```typescript
// Before:
import FaceBlurRecordScreen from "./FaceBlurRecordScreen";

// After:
const FaceBlurRecordScreen = lazy(() => import("./FaceBlurRecordScreen"));

// Usage with Suspense:
<Suspense fallback={<ActivityIndicator />}>
  <FaceBlurRecordScreen />
</Suspense>
```

**Reason**: Prevents worklets-dependent code from being evaluated in Expo Go or when not needed.

## Required Next Steps

### **CRITICAL: Rebuild iOS App**

The native modules need to be properly linked. Run these commands:

```bash
# 1. Clean iOS build
cd ios
rm -rf build
rm -rf Pods
rm Podfile.lock
cd ..

# 2. Reinstall pods
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# 3. Rebuild the iOS app
npx expo run:ios
```

### Alternative: Clean Rebuild
```bash
# Complete clean rebuild
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf ios/build ios/Pods ios/Podfile.lock
npm install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npx expo run:ios
```

## What Works Now

✅ Metro bundler starts without Babel errors
✅ JavaScript bundle compiles successfully  
✅ Worklets-core is properly disabled
✅ Vision Camera components load only when needed (lazy loading)

## What Needs Native Rebuild

⚠️ **react-native-reanimated** - Requires proper native linking
⚠️ **react-native-vision-camera** - Requires proper native linking  
⚠️ **react-native-vision-camera-face-detector** - Requires proper native linking

## Testing After Rebuild

1. **Start Metro**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. **Run iOS**:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios
   ```

3. **Verify**:
   - App launches without "HostFunction" errors
   - Reanimated animations work
   - Video recording screen loads (native builds only)

## Known Limitations

- **Expo Go**: Face blur and advanced video features will not work (uses fallback)
- **Worklets**: Disabled until New Architecture is enabled
- **Frame Processors**: Only available in development/production builds

## Files Changed

1. `index.ts` - Disabled worklets-core import
2. `babel.config.js` - Disabled worklets-core plugin
3. `src/screens/VideoRecordScreen.tsx` - Added lazy loading for FaceBlurRecordScreen
4. `App.tsx` - No changes needed (reanimated import is fine)

## Configuration Summary

### Babel Config (babel.config.js)
```javascript
plugins: [
  // ... other plugins
  "@babel/plugin-transform-class-static-block",
  // "react-native-worklets-core/plugin", // DISABLED
  "react-native-reanimated/plugin", // ENABLED
]
```

### Index.ts
```typescript
// import "react-native-worklets-core"; // DISABLED
import "react-native-reanimated"; // ENABLED
import "react-native-get-random-values";
```

## Troubleshooting

### If "HostFunction" error persists:
1. Ensure you've rebuilt the iOS app (not just restarted Metro)
2. Check that pods are installed: `cd ios && pod install`
3. Clean derived data: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
4. Try: `npx expo run:ios --clean`

### If Reanimated doesn't work:
1. Verify babel plugin is enabled
2. Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start --clear`
3. Rebuild iOS app
4. Check that `react-native-reanimated` is in dependencies

### If Vision Camera doesn't work:
1. Only works in development/production builds (not Expo Go)
2. Requires camera permissions
3. Requires proper pod installation
4. Check that native modules are linked

## Additional Notes

- The app uses **Expo SDK 54** with **React Native 0.81.4**
- **Reanimated v4.1.1** is installed and should work after rebuild
- **Vision Camera v4** requires development build
- Face blur features use ML Kit for face detection
