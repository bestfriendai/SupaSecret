# üö® CRITICAL: FFmpeg-Kit is Officially Retired

## The Bad News

**FFmpeg-kit has been officially retired** (archived June 23, 2025)

From the official repository:
> "FFmpegKit has been officially retired. There will be no further ffmpeg-kit releases."
> "All previously released ffmpeg-kit binaries will be removed according to the following schedule."

### Removal Schedule:
- **Version 6.0** (what we tried to install): Available until **April 1st, 2025**
- **Older versions**: Already removed (February 1st, 2025)

**This means the package will be completely unavailable in ~3 months.**

## Why This Changes Everything

### What We Tried
1. ‚úÖ Skia Frame Processors - **BLOCKED by New Architecture**
2. ‚úÖ BlurView Overlays - **DOESN'T work (not captured in recording)**
3. ‚úÖ FFmpeg Post-Processing - **PACKAGE RETIRED**

### Reality Check
**There is NO maintained solution for face blur with:**
- ‚úÖ New Architecture enabled
- ‚úÖ React Native / Expo
- ‚úÖ Ready-to-use library

## Your ONLY Real Options Now

### Option 1: Remove Face Blur Feature ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
**Time**: 0 minutes
**Cost**: $0
**Complexity**: None

**Why This is Best:**
- App works perfectly now
- No technical debt
- Can revisit when better solutions exist
- Focus on core app features

**Code Changes:**
- Remove FaceBlurRecordScreen
- Use standard VisionCameraRecordScreen
- Update UI to remove blur option

### Option 2: Build Native Modules üî®
**Time**: 2-4 weeks
**Cost**: Expert developer needed (~$5,000-10,000)
**Complexity**: VERY HIGH

**What This Involves:**
```swift
// iOS - Custom AVFoundation + Metal shader
class FaceBlurProcessor: NSObject {
    func processFrame(_ pixelBuffer: CVPixelBuffer, 
                     faceRects: [CGRect]) -> CVPixelBuffer {
        // Detect faces
        // Apply Metal blur shader
        // Encode to video
    }
}
```

```kotlin
// Android - MediaCodec + RenderScript
class FaceBlurProcessor {
    fun processFrame(frame: Image, 
                    faceRects: List<Rect>): Image {
        // Detect faces
        // Apply RenderScript blur
        // Encode to video
    }
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Expert iOS developer (Swift, Metal, AVFoundation)
- Expert Android developer (Kotlin, MediaCodec, RenderScript)
- React Native bridge expertise
- Weeks of testing

### Option 3: Cloud Processing ‚òÅÔ∏è
**Time**: 1-2 weeks
**Cost**: Server costs (~$100-500/month)
**Complexity**: MEDIUM

**Flow:**
1. Record video locally
2. Upload to cloud server
3. Server runs FFmpeg to blur faces
4. Download blurred video
5. Show to user

**Infrastructure Needed:**
- Cloud server (AWS/GCP)
- FFmpeg installed server-side
- S3 or similar for video storage
- Processing queue (SQS, etc.)

**Pros:**
- No app size increase
- Can use latest FFmpeg

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Privacy nightmare (videos leave device)
- ‚ùå Requires internet
- ‚ùå Slow (upload + process + download)
- ‚ùå Ongoing costs
- ‚ùå Storage compliance issues

### Option 4: Wait for Alternatives üìÖ
**Time**: Unknown (months? years?)
**Cost**: $0
**Complexity**: None now

**What to Wait For:**
- Community fork of ffmpeg-kit (none exist yet)
- New React Native video processing library
- Skia/New Architecture compatibility fix
- Native Expo module for video processing

**Risk**: May never happen

## The Technical Reality

### Why Face Blur is So Hard

**Requirements:**
1. Real-time face detection ‚úÖ (MLKit works)
2. Real-time blur rendering ‚ùå (Skia conflicts with New Arch)
3. Video encoding with blur ‚ùå (FFmpeg retired)

**The Problem:**
- VisionCamera records at **native camera layer**
- React components (BlurView) are at **UI layer**
- These layers don't mix in recordings
- Need native code to manipulate video buffers

**Apps That Do This:**
- Snapchat: Custom C++ pipeline, millions in R&D
- TikTok: Custom Metal/Vulkan shaders
- Instagram: Years of native development

### Why FFmpeg Mattered

FFmpeg was the ONLY cross-platform solution that:
- ‚úÖ Worked on iOS + Android
- ‚úÖ Had React Native bindings
- ‚úÖ Handled video encoding
- ‚úÖ Was production-ready

**Without it:** You need platform-specific native code.

## My Strong Recommendation

### Remove the Face Blur Feature

**Why:**
1. **No viable solution exists** with New Architecture
2. **FFmpeg is retired** - only option is disappearing
3. **Native development** takes weeks and expert knowledge
4. **Cloud processing** kills privacy (your app's main value)
5. **App works fine** without it

**What to Tell Users:**
- "Face blur temporarily disabled while we improve it"
- "Use our other privacy features (voice masking, etc.)"
- "Coming back in future update"

**Focus Instead On:**
- ‚úÖ Voice masking (already works)
- ‚úÖ Anonymous posting (already works)
- ‚úÖ Content moderation (already works)
- ‚úÖ Other features that actually work

### The Honest Truth

Face blur was a **nice-to-have** feature. Your app's core value is:
- Anonymous confessions
- Community engagement
- Content discovery

Face blur doesn't make or break that value proposition.

## If You MUST Have Face Blur

Then you need to:

1. **Hire expert native developers** ($5k-10k)
2. **Budget 2-4 weeks** for development
3. **Accept ongoing maintenance** burden
4. **Test extensively** on many devices

OR

1. **Disable New Architecture** (lose future compatibility)
2. **Accept Skia warnings** (may break in future)
3. **Ship quickly** but with technical debt

## Next Steps

**I recommend:**
1. ‚úÖ Remove face blur code (I can do this)
2. ‚úÖ Fix FileSystem deprecations (I can do this)
3. ‚úÖ Run lint + expo doctor (I can do this)
4. ‚úÖ Ship app with other features working

**You decide:**
- Option 1: Remove feature (1 hour)
- Option 2: Native modules (weeks + expert)
- Option 3: Cloud processing (weeks + costs)
- Option 4: Wait indefinitely

**I cannot make ffmpeg-kit work because it's retired and being removed.**

What do you want to do?
