## Service Dependencies and Requirements

### RevenueCat Service
- Expo Go: No native dependencies, demo mode only
- Development Build: Requires react-native-purchases
- Environment Variables: EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_*_KEY
- External Dependencies: RevenueCat dashboard configuration
- Fallback Strategy: Demo mode with realistic purchase simulation

### AdMob Service
- Expo Go: No native dependencies, demo mode only
- Development Build: Requires react-native-google-mobile-ads
- Environment Variables: EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMOB_* ad unit IDs
- External Dependencies: AdMob dashboard, app registration
- Fallback Strategy: Demo ads with timing simulation

### Supabase Service
- Expo Go: Full functionality, no native dependencies
- Development Build: Full functionality
- Environment Variables: EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- External Dependencies: Supabase project, database schema
- Fallback Strategy: Graceful degradation with error handling

### Video Processing Service
- Expo Go: Server-side processing via Edge Functions
- Development Build: Local processing + server fallback
- Environment Variables: Supabase configuration for Edge Functions
- External Dependencies: FFmpeg, ML Kit (dev build only)
- Fallback Strategy: Server-side processing when local fails

## Testing Strategy by Environment

### Expo Go Testing
- ✅ Test all demo modes function correctly
- ✅ Verify no crashes when native modules are missing
- ✅ Test service initialization with missing dependencies
- ✅ Validate error handling for unsupported features
- ✅ Test UI behavior with demo data

### Development Build Testing
- ✅ Test all native modules load correctly
- ✅ Verify real service integrations work
- ✅ Test fallback to demo mode when services fail
- ✅ Validate environment variable handling
- ✅ Test production-like scenarios

### Production Build Testing
- ✅ Test with production service configurations
- ✅ Verify all environment variables are set
- ✅ Test error handling and recovery
- ✅ Validate performance under load
- ✅ Test security and privacy compliance

## Environment Variable Requirements by Environment

### Development (Expo Go)
- Required: EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- Optional: All other variables (services run in demo mode)
- Validation: Basic format checking only

### Development (Development Build)
- Required: All Supabase variables
- Recommended: All service variables for full testing
- Optional: Production-only variables
- Validation: Format and connectivity checking

### Production
- Required: All service environment variables
- Critical: Production Supabase, RevenueCat, AdMob configurations
- Validation: Full validation including service connectivity

## Service Integration Patterns

### Initialization Pattern
```
1. ServiceInitializer.initializeAllServices()
2. Check environment (Expo Go vs Development Build)
3. Initialize each service with appropriate mode
4. Return structured result with success/failure status
5. Handle initialization errors gracefully
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```
1. Detect service availability
2. Attempt operation with timeout
3. Retry with exponential backoff if appropriate
4. Fall back to demo mode or graceful degradation
5. Log error with context for debugging
```

### Feature Flag Pattern
```
1. Check feature flag in production.ts
2. Verify environment supports feature
3. Initialize service if enabled and supported
4. Provide fallback if service unavailable
5. Log feature status for monitoring
```

## Service Health Monitoring

### Health Check Implementation
- ✅ Supabase: Connection and auth validation
- ❌ RevenueCat: Missing health check implementation
- ❌ AdMob: Missing health check implementation
- ❌ Video Processing: Missing health check implementation
- ❌ Service Coordinator: Missing overall health monitoring

### Recommended Health Checks
- RevenueCat: Validate API key and fetch customer info
- AdMob: Validate ad unit IDs and test ad request
- Video Processing: Test Edge Function connectivity
- Service Coordinator: Aggregate health status from all services

## Performance Considerations

### Service Initialization Performance
- Current: Sequential initialization of all services
- Recommendation: Parallel initialization where possible
- Critical Path: Supabase (required for app functionality)
- Non-Critical: AdMob, RevenueCat (can initialize in background)

### Runtime Performance
- Supabase: Excellent (optimized client)
- RevenueCat: Good (cached subscription status)
- AdMob: Good (proper cooldown and caching)
- Video Processing: Variable (depends on processing method)

### Memory Usage
- All services: Proper cleanup implemented
- Potential Issues: Real-time subscriptions need monitoring
- Recommendations: Implement memory usage monitoring

## Security Considerations by Environment

### Expo Go Security
- ✅ No sensitive operations (demo mode only)
- ✅ Environment variables properly scoped
- ✅ No native module security concerns

### Development Build Security
- ✅ Test environment isolation
- ⚠️ Development keys should be separate from production
- ✅ Proper secret management for testing

### Production Security
- ✅ Environment variables properly secured
- ✅ API keys stored in EAS secrets
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in code
- ⚠️ Need API key rotation strategy

## Deployment Considerations

### Expo Go Deployment
- ✅ No additional configuration needed
- ✅ Demo modes work out of the box
- ✅ No native dependencies to manage

### Development Build Deployment
- ⚠️ Requires EAS Build with native dependencies
- ⚠️ Need proper config plugins for all services
- ⚠️ Platform-specific configurations required

### Production Deployment
- ❌ Requires all environment variables configured
- ❌ Need production service accounts and configurations
- ❌ Requires app store approval for native permissions
- ❌ Need monitoring and alerting setup
