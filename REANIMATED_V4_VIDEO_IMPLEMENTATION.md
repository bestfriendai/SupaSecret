## üé® Animation Stack with Reanimated v4

### Configuration
```javascript
// babel.config.js
plugins: [
  "react-native-worklets-core/plugin",
  "react-native-reanimated/plugin", // Must be last
]
```

### Dependencies
```json
"react-native-reanimated": "^4.1.0",
"react-native-worklets-core": "^1.6.2",
"react-native-vision-camera": "^4.5.2"
```

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ **Worklets Support**: Separate worklets package for modular use
- ‚úÖ **Frame Processors**: Real-time video effects with Vision Camera
- ‚úÖ **New Architecture Ready**: Required for Reanimated v4
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NativeWind Limitation**: NativeWind v4 has limited compatibility

## üì± Environment-Aware Implementation

### Expo Go (Testing)
```javascript
// Automatic fallbacks
- Vision Camera ‚Üí Expo Camera
- FFmpeg ‚Üí Basic processing
- Frame processors ‚Üí Disabled
- Worklets ‚Üí Not available
```

### Development Build (Full Features)
```javascript
// All features enabled
- Vision Camera v4 ‚úÖ
- FFmpeg processing ‚úÖ
- Frame processors ‚úÖ
- Worklets ‚úÖ
- ML Kit ‚úÖ
```

### Production Build
```javascript
// Optimized with all features
- Minified code
- All native modules
- Full processing capabilities
```

---

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Recording with Vision Camera v4
```typescript
import { getUnifiedVideoService } from '@/services/UnifiedVideoService';

const service = await getUnifiedVideoService();
const components = service.getRecordingComponent();

if (components.isAvailable) {
  const { Camera, useFrameProcessor } = components;

  // Use Vision Camera v4 with frame processors
  const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
    'worklet';
    // Real-time processing with Reanimated v4 worklets
  }, []);
}
```

### Processing Video
```typescript
const processed = await service.processVideo(videoUri, {
  quality: 'high',
  blur: true, // Face blur if available
  trim: { start: 0, end: 30 }
});
```

### Check Capabilities
```typescript
const capabilities = service.getCapabilities();

console.log('Vision Camera:', capabilities.recording.visionCamera);
console.log('FFmpeg:', capabilities.recording.ffmpeg);
console.log('Reanimated v4:', capabilities.animation.reanimatedV4);
console.log('Worklets:', capabilities.animation.worklets);
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### NativeWind v4 + Reanimated v4
- **Issue**: Limited compatibility between NativeWind v4 and Reanimated v4
- **Workaround**: Use inline styles for animated components
- **Future**: Wait for NativeWind v5 or official compatibility update

### Expo Go Limitations
- No Vision Camera (uses Expo Camera)
- No FFmpeg (basic processing only)
- No worklets (animations limited)
- No frame processors

### New Architecture Requirement
- Reanimated v4 requires New Architecture
- Not enabled by default in Expo SDK 54
- Will be mandatory in SDK 55

---

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Frame Processing
- **Vision Camera v4**: 60 FPS real-time processing
- **Worklets**: Near-native performance
- **Skia Integration**: GPU-accelerated effects

### Video Compression
- **FFmpeg**: Up to 80% size reduction
- **Quality Options**: low/medium/high/highest
- **Format Support**: MP4, MOV, H.264, H.265

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### From react-native-video-processing
```javascript
// Old (deprecated)
import VideoPlayer from 'react-native-video-processing';

// New
import { getUnifiedVideoService } from '@/services/UnifiedVideoService';
const service = await getUnifiedVideoService();
```

### From Reanimated v3 to v4
```javascript
// Add worklets-core
npm install react-native-worklets-core

// Update babel.config.js
plugins: [
  "react-native-worklets-core/plugin",
  "react-native-reanimated/plugin"
]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Worklets not found"
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
npx expo start --clear
npm install react-native-worklets-core
```

### "Vision Camera not available"
```bash
# Not available in Expo Go
# Create development build:
eas build --platform ios --profile development
```

### "Reanimated v4 crashes"
```bash
# Ensure New Architecture is enabled
# Or downgrade to v3:
npm install react-native-reanimated@~3.17.4
```
