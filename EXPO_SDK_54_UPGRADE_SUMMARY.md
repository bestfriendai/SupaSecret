# Expo SDK 54 & React Native 0.81.4 Upgrade Summary

## ✅ Successfully Completed Upgrade

Your React Native app has been successfully upgraded from React Native 0.76.5 to **React Native 0.81.4** and **Expo SDK 54.0.1**.

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing app-icon.png Asset Error**

- **Problem**: Metro bundler was looking for `/assets/app-icon.png` which didn't exist
- **Solution**: Created `assets/app-icon.png` by copying the existing `assets/icon.png`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. **React Native Version Mismatch**

- **Problem**: Had React Native 0.76.5, but Expo SDK 54 requires 0.81.4
- **Solution**: Updated using `npx expo install --check` which automatically installed the correct version
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. **React Version Mismatch**

- **Problem**: Had React 18.3.1, but Expo SDK 54 requires 19.1.0
- **Solution**: Updated using `npx expo install --check`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 4. **Reanimated Babel Plugin Configuration**

- **Problem**: Warning about `react-native-reanimated/plugin` being moved to `react-native-worklets`
- **Solution**: Already correctly configured in `babel.config.js` to use `react-native-worklets/plugin`
- **Status**: ✅ Already Fixed

### 5. **Duplicate Dependencies**

- **Problem**: Multiple versions of expo-dev-menu causing potential build issues
- **Solution**: Removed `expo-dev-launcher` from package.json as it shouldn't be installed directly
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## 📦 Current Versions

- **React Native**: 0.81.4 ✅

## 🔍 Configuration Files Updated

### `babel.config.js`

- All dependencies now compatible with Expo SDK 54

## ⚠️ Remaining Minor Issues

### Duplicate Dependencies (Non-Critical)

- There's still a duplicate `expo-dev-menu` dependency in the dependency tree
- This is a transitive dependency issue and doesn't affect app functionality
- Can be ignored for development, but may need resolution for production builds

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations
