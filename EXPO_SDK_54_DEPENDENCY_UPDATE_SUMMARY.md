# Expo SDK 54 Dependency Update Summary

## Task Completion Date

September 11, 2025

## Objective

Update project dependencies to ensure full compatibility with Expo SDK 54, React Native 0.81, and document any breaking changes for future resolution.

## Dependencies Successfully Updated

### 1. React Navigation (v6 → v7) - CRITICAL UPDATE

All React Navigation packages have been upgraded from v6 to v7:

- `@react-navigation/native`: ^6.1.26 → ^7.0.0
- `@react-navigation/native-stack`: ^6.11.0 → ^7.0.0
- `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`: ^6.6.1 → ^7.0.0
- `@react-navigation/drawer`: ^6.7.2 → ^7.0.0
- `@react-navigation/stack`: ^6.4.1 → ^7.0.0
- `@react-navigation/material-top-tabs`: ^6.6.15 → ^7.0.0

### 2. React & React DOM Version Alignment

Fixed version mismatch to satisfy React Native 0.81.0 peer dependencies:

- `react`: 18.3.1 → 19.1.0
- `react-dom`: 18.3.1 → 19.1.0

### 3. React Native Version

Maintained at the correct version for Expo SDK 54:

- `react-native`: 0.81.0 (no change - already correct)

### 4. Other Key Dependencies Maintained

The following were kept at their current versions as they are already compatible:

- `expo`: ^54.0.1 (already at SDK 54)
- `react-native-reanimated`: ^4.1.0 (already at v4 as requested)
- `nativewind`: 4.1.23 (maintained as specified)

## Installation Results

- **Added packages**: 67 total
- **Removed packages**: 340 total
- **Changed packages**: 80 total
- **Total packages**: 1510
- **Security vulnerabilities**: 35 (2 low, 6 moderate, 27 critical) - to be addressed separately

## Breaking Changes Documented

### React Navigation v7 Migration

A detailed migration guide has been created in `REACT_NAVIGATION_V7_MIGRATION.md` documenting:

- Navigation state changes requiring updates
- New Navigation ID system implementation needed
- TypeScript type updates required
- Component prop changes in navigators
- Screen option prop updates needed

### Files That Will Need Updates (Not Modified Yet)

Per instructions, no code changes were made. The following files will need updates:

1. `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Main navigation setup
2. `src/navigation/BottomTabNavigator.tsx` - Tab navigation configuration
3. `src/navigation/DrawerNavigator.tsx` - Drawer navigation setup
4. `src/screens/*.tsx` - All screen components using navigation props
5. `src/types/navigation.ts` - Navigation TypeScript types

## NativeWind Status

- Version 4.1.23 maintained as requested
- Known TypeScript issues with SDK 54 remain (will need future resolution)
- No changes made to NativeWind configuration

## Next Steps Required (For Future Implementation)

1. **Fix React Navigation v7 breaking changes** - Update all navigation code to v7 API
2. **Update TypeScript types** - Align navigation types with v7
3. **Test navigation flows** - Verify all navigation features work correctly
4. **Address NativeWind TypeScript issues** - Resolve type errors with SDK 54
5. **Security audit** - Address the 35 vulnerabilities reported by npm audit

## Commands to Verify Installation

```bash
# Check installed versions
npm list @react-navigation/native react react-dom react-native

# Check for peer dependency issues
npm ls

# Run security audit
npm audit
```

## Important Notes

- ✅ All dependency updates completed successfully
- ✅ No peer dependency conflicts remaining
- ⚠️ Breaking changes documented but not fixed (as requested)
- ⚠️ Security vulnerabilities present but not addressed
- ℹ️ Project will not run correctly until navigation code is updated for v7

## Files Modified

1. `package.json` - Updated with new dependency versions
2. `package-lock.json` - Updated via npm install
3. `REACT_NAVIGATION_V7_MIGRATION.md` - Created migration guide
4. `EXPO_SDK_54_DEPENDENCY_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document
