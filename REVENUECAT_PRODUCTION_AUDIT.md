# RevenueCat Production Readiness Audit

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. Environment Variable Validation Missing
- Issue: RevenueCat API keys are hardcoded in production.ts with placeholder values
- Impact: Service will fail in production without proper key configuration
- Fix: Add runtime validation for EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_KEY and EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_ANDROID_KEY
- Validation: Ensure keys follow RevenueCat format (appl_* for iOS, goog_* for Android)
- Effort: Low (2-4 hours)

### 2. Missing Subscription Restoration on App Launch
- Issue: App doesn't automatically restore purchases when user opens app
- Impact: Users may lose premium access after app restart
- Fix: Add automatic restoration call in ServiceInitializer.initializeAllServices()
- Implementation: Call RevenueCatService.restorePurchases() during initialization
- Effort: Medium (4-8 hours)

### 3. No Retry Logic for Failed Purchases
- Issue: Purchase failures are not retried automatically
- Impact: Users may experience purchase failures due to temporary network issues
- Fix: Implement exponential backoff retry for purchase operations
- Implementation: Add retry wrapper around purchasePackage() calls
- Effort: Medium (6-8 hours)

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Missing Purchase Analytics
- Issue: No tracking of purchase funnel, conversion rates, or failure reasons
- Impact: Cannot optimize subscription flow or debug purchase issues
- Fix: Add analytics events for purchase attempts, successes, failures, and restorations
- Integration: Send events to Firebase Analytics and Sentry
- Effort: Medium (8-12 hours)

### 2. Subscription Expiry Handling
- Issue: No proactive handling of subscription expiry
- Impact: Users may continue to see premium features after subscription expires
- Fix: Add subscription expiry monitoring and grace period handling
- Implementation: Check expiry dates and implement 24-hour grace period
- Effort: High (12-16 hours)

### 3. Missing Entitlement Validation
- Issue: Premium status check only looks at active subscriptions, not entitlements
- Impact: May miss promotional or lifetime entitlements
- Fix: Update isUserPremium() to check both entitlements and subscriptions
- Implementation: Prioritize entitlements.active over activeSubscriptions
- Effort: Low (2-4 hours)

## Medium Priority Issues

### 1. Hardcoded Product Identifiers
- Issue: Product IDs are hardcoded in production.ts
- Impact: Cannot easily change product offerings without code updates
- Fix: Move product IDs to remote configuration or Supabase
- Implementation: Create products table in Supabase with remote sync
- Effort: High (16-20 hours)

### 2. Missing Subscription Management
- Issue: No UI for users to manage subscriptions (cancel, change plans)
- Impact: Users must go to App Store/Play Store to manage subscriptions
- Fix: Add subscription management screen with deep links to store
- Implementation: Create SubscriptionManagementScreen with platform-specific links
- Effort: High (20-24 hours)

## Error Handling Improvements

### 1. Standardize Error Messages
- Current: Generic error messages for all purchase failures
- Improvement: Specific error messages for different failure types
- Implementation: Map RevenueCat error codes to user-friendly messages
- Add error code documentation and troubleshooting guide

### 2. Add Error Recovery
- Current: Errors are logged but no automatic recovery
- Improvement: Implement automatic retry for recoverable errors
- Implementation: Classify errors as recoverable/non-recoverable
- Add exponential backoff for network-related failures

### 3. Improve Error Reporting
- Current: Only console logging for errors
- Improvement: Send error events to analytics and crash reporting
- Implementation: Integrate with Sentry for error tracking
- Add custom error context (user ID, product ID, error type)

## Expo Go vs Development Build Compatibility

### Current Implementation: âœ… GOOD
- Proper Expo Go detection using Constants.appOwnership
- Demo mode with realistic purchase simulation
- No runtime crashes in Expo Go environment
- Clear logging to indicate demo mode

### Recommendations for Improvement
- Add visual indicators in UI when running in demo mode
- Implement demo purchase history for testing
- Add demo subscription expiry simulation
- Create demo mode configuration options
