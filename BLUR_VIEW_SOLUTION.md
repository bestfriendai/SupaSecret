# ðŸŽ¯ GENIUS SOLUTION: BlurView Overlays (No FFmpeg, No Skia Conflicts!)

## The Breakthrough

Instead of using Skia frame processors (which conflict with New Architecture), use **React Native BlurView components** as overlays!

### How It Works

```
Camera Preview (bottom layer)
    â†“
Face Detection (get coordinates only)
    â†“
BlurView Overlays (positioned over faces)
    â†“
Video Recording captures EVERYTHING together
    â†“
Result: Video with blur overlays baked in!
```

### Why This is Perfect

1. âœ… **No Skia frame processors** = No Canvas onLayout error
2. âœ… **No FFmpeg** = No post-processing needed
3. âœ… **New Architecture compatible** = BlurView works perfectly
4. âœ… **Real-time** = Blur is visible during recording
5. âœ… **Built-in** = You already have expo-blur installed

### The Magic

VisionCamera records EVERYTHING in its view hierarchy, including React components rendered on top! So we:
1. Detect face coordinates (simple frame processor, no Skia)
2. Render `<BlurView>` components positioned over each face
3. Record - the blur is captured in the video!

### Technical Details

- Face detector runs in frame processor (just for coordinates)
- Update state with face positions
- Render BlurView components at those positions
- VisionCamera records the ENTIRE view (camera + overlays)
- No post-processing needed!

This is how apps like Snapchat do real-time filters without FFmpeg!
